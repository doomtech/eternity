 Additional Terms and Conditions for The Eternity Engine

 Copyright (C) 2013 James Haley.
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

1. Additional Permission for Licensing Reciprocity

   If code originating from a third-party program (henceforth referred to as
   "project") covered under the terms of the GNU General Public License Version
   2 or higher has been integrated into The Eternity Engine, permission is 
   granted to re-incorporate into the original project any changes to that 
   code made within The Eternity Engine under the terms of the same Version 2 
   license, or any later version thereof, so long as the project meets the 
   following criteria:
   
   a) The project does not contain any Technological Measure as defined by the
      Digital Millennium Copyright Act of United States law for the purpose
      of restricting the ability to freely execute or distribute the compiled
      binary program code, whether or not any modifications are made to the
      source code or binary image.
   
   b) The project is not dependent upon any undisclosed cryptographic keys used
      for the purpose of signing code for execution on platforms where such 
      signing is required in order for a modified version of the source code
      to be compiled and executed in binary form by any recipient of the source
      code, and a suitable replacement key cannot be obtained automatically by
      an end user.
      
   c) The project does not require a written request for the source code, as
      was allowed under GNU General Public License Version 2, Section 3, 
      Item (b), unless the project is distributed only on a physical medium, as 
      is allowed under GNU General Public License Version 3, Section 6, 
      Item (b).
      
   If any of the above three conditions are not met, the project maintainers 
   will be bound by the full terms of the GNU General Public License Version 3 
   when adopting any changes made within The Eternity Engine.
   
2. Allowable Additional Restrictions

   To the extent allowed by the GNU General Public License version 3, Section 7, 
   the following terms and conditions apply to all code for which the only 
   copyright owners are part of The Eternity Engine development team (also doing 
   business as "Team Eternity"):
   
   a) Preservation of specified reasonable legal notices and author attributions
      in the material taken from The Eternity Engine and in any Appropriate 
      Legal Notices displayed is required.
      
   b) Misrepresentation of the origin of material taken from The Eternity Engine
      is forbidden.

   Source code files to which the terms in this section apply are clearly marked
   in the files' headers to refer to this list of terms and conditions. Terms in
   this Section shall not be construed so as to limit any rights granted by the
   terms of Section 1.
