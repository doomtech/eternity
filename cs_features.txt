### Client/Server Features

Here are some features added in EE's client/server version, all of which really
are relative to the other c/s ports.

  - Extremely smooth, high fidelity netcode; other players and moving sectors
    (like platforms, elevators, doors, etc.) neither skip, jerk, nor warp, and
    network quality issues (latency, packet loss, packet ordering) are well-
    compensated for.
  - Highly accurate backwards reconciliation (unlagged) for hitscan weapons.
    - Handles moving sectors.
    - Handles changing player states like invulnerability.
  - Master server with built-in web launcher (no separate launcher application
    is necessary).
  - On-the-fly WAD loading.
  - Per-map configuration overrides.
  - Spectators.
  - 32 players.
  - 2 teams.
  - Player queue system.
  - 4 separate authorization levels: spectator, player, moderator &
    administrator.
    - Clients save valid passwords and authenticate automatically if possible.
  - ZDoom Bridge things.
  - 3D radius attacks, used mainly for rocket jumping.
  - New multiplayer scoreboards.
  - Extended mouselook from 32 to 56 degrees.
  - Efficient handling of maps with large numbers of monsters, status is only
    broadcast upon a change.
  - TeamDM and CTF game modes (in addition to staples like Duel, FFA and
    Cooperative).
  - RCON.
  - Network demos, split by map and including JSON metadata.
  - Multibinds - multiple keys can be bound together to one key.

  - Preferred weapon order.
    - Can also switch when picking up ammo of a preferred weapon.
