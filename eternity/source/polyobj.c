/*
   Theory behind Polyobjects:

      "The BSP tree hidden surface removal algorithm can easily be
      extended to allow for dynamic objects. For each frame, start with
      a BSP tree containing all the static objects in the scene, and
      reinsert the dynamic objects. While this is straightforward to
      implement, it can involve substantial computation.
       
      "If a dynamic object is separated from each static object by a
      plane, the dynamic object can be represented as a single point
      regardless of its complexity. This can dramatically reduce the
      computation per frame because only one node per dynamic object is
      inserted into the BSP tree. Compare that to one node for every
      polygon in the object, and the reason for the savings is obvious.
      During tree traversal, each point is expanded into the original
      object...

      "Inserting a point into the BSP tree is very cheap, because there
      is only one front/back test at each node. Points are never split,
      which explains the requirement of separation by a plane. The
      dynamic object will always be drawn completely in front of the
      static objects behind it.

      "...a different front/back test is necessary, because a point 
      doesn't partition three dimesnional (sic) space. The correct 
      front/back test is to simply compare distances to the eye. Once 
      computed, this distance can be cached at the node until the frame
      is drawn."

   From http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/bsptree-faq/ (The BSP FAQ)

   While Hexen had polyobjects, it put severe and artificial limits upon
   them by keeping them attached to one subsector, and allowing only one
   per subsector. Neither is necessary, and removing those limitations
   results in the free-moving polyobjects implemented here. The only
   true - and unavoidable - restriction is that polyobjects should never
   overlap with each other or with static walls.

   The reason that multiple polyobjects per subsector is viable is that
   with the above assumption that the objects will not overlap, if the 
   center point of one polyobject is closer to the viewer than the center
   point of another, then the entire polyobject is closer to the viewer. 
   In this way it is possible to impose an order on polyobjects within a 
   subsector, as well as allowing the BSP tree to impose its natural 
   ordering on polyobjects amongst all subsectors.
