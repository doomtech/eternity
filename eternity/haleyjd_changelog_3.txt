Figured out why flat swirling was crashing. SoM was accidentally accessing
flattranslation[-1] several times, and then asking W_CacheLumpNum to work with
the essentially random value. Fixed by restoring the normal value to the
flattranslation lookup after recording its -1 state to determine swirling.

I also found out that my portal tainting system wasn't quite complete. Only the
first generation of child portals were properly reset, and portals were still
starting out with an uninitialized taint value at the beginning of the level,
which would cause spurious rendering failures the first time you laid eyes on
them (dunno how I missed this).

Numerous issues have been found by different people in 3.33.33, so a maintenance
release will most likely be forthcoming in the near future. Work has already
begun, actually.

I found an easy way to vastly optimize the blockmap unlinking operation for
PolyObjects. During linking, the polymaplink_t's generated are now stored on an
additional single-linked list that originates in the PolyObject itself. This way
when the object is unlinked, I can simply run down this single-linked list and
delete each node instead of searching the blockmap for the links. It's so simple
that I'm plain sick that I didn't think of it earlier :P
