Basic Installation
==================

   To install on linux do:

      ./autogen.sh
      make
      make install   (as root/with sudo)
      ./lindirs.sh

   This installs eternity to /usr/local/games and the eternity base dir to
   ~/.eternity/base . This is where the eternity EDFs and wads are stored,
   as well as screenshots (in base/shots) and configs (in base/doom and 
   base/heretic). Note that lindirs.sh is the thing setting up the wad
   and screenshot dirs, as well as copying over the wads and edfs, not
   make install.

   lindirs.sh also checks that an environment variable called ETERNITYBASE
   exists (this points to the ee base dir) and if not, adds
   
      export ETERNITYBASE='~/.eternity/base'

   to your .bashrc .
