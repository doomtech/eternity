<b>Introduction</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
This documentation covers how the Small scripting system is implemented in the Eternity
Engine and how it can be used. This is not a general reference or tutorial for the Small
scripting language; see the other documentation on the Eternity Engine webpage for more
information.

<b>VMs: Gamescript and Levelscript</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
The Eternity Engine contains two Small virtual machines, known as the Gamescript and
Levelscript. Both of these and the ways in which they can interact are explained in the
subsections below.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="gamescript">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>The Gamescript</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
The Gamescript is an optional set of global scripts which can be invoked at any time during
execution. These scripts are shared between levels, and as such, this VM can act as "glue" to
connect the scripts of individual maps. Levelscripts are not required for a Gamescript to
be loaded.
<br><br>

<p>
<a name="addinggs">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Adding a Gamescript</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
The Gamescript is a normally compiled Small AMX file inserted into the GAMESCR lump in any
wad. Only the last such GAMESCR lump will be loaded, and the functions and variables inside
it will become available.  The Gamescript area is initialized at startup, and if it contains
an OnInit() function, that function will be executed once and only once when the 
"A_InitGameScript" message appears in the console. The OnInit() function is optional, and
if it does not exist, no error will occur.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="invokegs">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Invoking Gamescripts</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
Here are the various ways Gamescript public functions (aka scripts) may be invoked:
<ul>
<li> Console Commands
     <br><br>
     The a_execv and a_execi console commands can run public Small functions which
     take either no parameters, or any number of integer parameters respectively. By
     passing the second parameter ("vm") as the number 0, you will indicate to look
     for the named function in the Gamescript VM. If the named function does not exist
     in the Gamescript, an error message will be printed. See the
     <a href="console_ref.html">Eternity Engine Console Reference</a> for full 
     information.
     <br><br>
<li> Cross-VM Execution
     <br><br>
     Using the Small function <a href="small_funcref.html#_ExecGS">_ExecGS</a>, it is
     possible to execute Gamescript functions by name from any function in the Levelscript.
     If the Gamescript is not loaded or _ExecGS is called from within the Gamescript itself, 
     the current script will be aborted and an error message will appear in the console.
     <br><br>
<li> Registering Callbacks
     <br><br>
     Callbacks may be registered from OnInit or from any other Gamescript function which
     may then repeatedly call Gamescript functions under the _INVOKE_CALLBACK invocation
     model.  See the <a href="small_funcref.html#_SetCallback">_SetCallback</a> function for
     full information. Gamescript callbacks can run at any point during the game, so it
     is important to monitor the current game mode if using functions which can only be
     used during levels, etc. If a function is called at an inappropriate time, the 
     callback will be aborted with an "Invalid gamemode for native function" error.
     <br><br>
<li> EDF/BEX Codepointers
     <br><br>
     The StartScript and PlayerStartScript codepointers may both execute Gamescripts by
     number. Only public functions which are named in the fashion "Script#", where # is
     any positive integer value, and accept 3 integer parameters can be invoked using these 
     codepointers. The numeric value used in the function name is passed to the codepointer as 
     an argument (via the EDF/BEX args frame values).  Use the number 0 as the second parameter 
     to either of these codepointers to indicate the Gamescript as the target VM. If the 
     Gamescript is not loaded in this case, the codepointer will perform no action. See the
     <a href="codeptrs.html">Eternity Engine Definitive Codepointer Reference</a> for full
     information.
     <br><br>
     Warning: If StartScript or PlayerStartScript are called from frames into which an
     object is set by other scripts, or they call a script which may change the object's
     state, any new script started will be executed recursively. This means that the second 
     script will be executing before the first has finished. Be sure to carefully account for 
     this in your scripting logic, and do not erroneously assume that any other script must
     have finished executing before the one that is currently running, or that other scripts
     will not execute before the current script has finished.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="gamevars">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Using Gamescript Variables</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
Like any compiled Small program, the Gamescript may contain scalar global variables
declared as "public." These variables, aside from being normally accessable from any
function within the Gamescript, can also be accessed from outside by using the 
<a href="small_funcref.html#_GetGameVar">_GetGameVar</a> and
<a href="small_funcref.html#_SetGameVar">_SetGameVar</a> functions. Using these functions
in your Levelscripts can allow maps to affect each other, by having one map set a variable
in the Gamescript, and then having another one check it. This is analogous to game and
hub variables in ACS and FraggleScript.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="levelscript">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>The Levelscript</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
The Levelscript is an optional set of map-local scripts which can be invoked only while the
map which owns those scripts is being played. A Gamescript is not required for Levelscripts
to be loaded. Levelscripts cannot access the scripts of other levels, but they can access
public functions and variables of the Gamescript, and the Gamescript can access public 
functions and variables of the currently loaded Levelscript.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="addingls">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Adding a Levelscript</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
The Levelscript is a normally compiled Small AMX file inserted into any lump. The lump must
be attached to the map using <a href="mapinfo.html">MapInfo</a>. The "levelscript"
value for the map must be set to the name of the lump containing the compiled scripts for
that level. The Levelscript area is initialized during level setup, and if the currently
loaded Levelscript contains an OnInit() function, that function will be executed once and only 
once, provided a save game is not being loaded. The OnInit() function is optional, and if it
does not exist, no error will occur.
<br><br>

<b>Invoking Levelscripts</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
Here are the various ways Levelscript public functions (aka scripts) may be invoked:
<ul>
<li> Console Commands
     <br><br>
     The a_execv and a_execi console commands can run public Small functions which
     take either no parameters, or any number of integer parameters respectively. By
     passing the second parameter ("vm") as the number 1, you will indicate to look

     in the Levelscript, an error message will be printed. See the
     <a href="console_ref.html">Eternity Engine Console Reference</a> for full 
     information.
     <br><br>
<li> Cross-VM Execution
     <br><br>
     Using the Small function <a href="small_funcref.html#_ExecLS">_ExecLS</a>, it is
     possible to execute Levelscript functions by name from any function in the Gamescript.
     If the Levelscript is not loaded or ExecLS is called from within the Levelscript, the
     current script will be aborted and an error message will appear in the console. Note
     that ExecLS can only call functions in the current level's Levelscript. State may be
     transferred between levels using public Gamescript global variables.
     <br><br>
<li> Registering Callbacks
     <br><br>
     Callbacks may be registered from OnInit or from any other Levelscript function which
     may then repeatedly call Levelscript functions under the _INVOKE_CALLBACK invocation
     model.  See the <a href="small_funcref.html#_SetCallback">_SetCallback</a> function for
     full information. Levelscript callbacks can only run during gameplay on that map, and
     any scheduled Levelscript callbacks will be killed immediately any time a level is exited 
     in any manner.
     <br><br>
<li> EDF/BEX Codepointers
     <br><br>
     The StartScript and PlayerStartScript codepointers may both execute Levelscripts by
     number. Only public functions which are named in the fashion "Script#", where # is
     any positive integer value, and accept 3 integer parameters can be invoked using these 
     codepointers. The numeric value used in the function name is passed to the codepointer as 
     an argument (via the EDF/BEX args frame values).  Use the number 1 as the second parameter 
     to either of these codepointers to indicate the Levelscript as the target VM. If the 
     Levelscript is not loaded in this case, the codepointer will perform no action. See the
     <a href="codeptrs.html">Eternity Engine Definitive Codepointer Reference</a> for full
     information.
     <br><br>
     Warning: If StartScript or PlayerStartScript are called from frames into which an
     object is set by other scripts, or they call a script which may change the object's
     state, any new script started will be executed recursively. This means that the second 
     script will be executing before the first has finished. Be sure to carefully account for 
     this in your scripting logic, and do not erroneously assume that any other script must
     have finished executing before the one that is currently running, or that other scripts
     will not execute before the current script has finished.
     <br><br>
<li> Script Linedefs
     <br><br>
     Levelscripts may also be executed by number using the same naming convention for
     the StartScript codepointers, but accepting zero parameters and using the tag of the
     line as the script number, with one of the following specials:
     <ul>
     <li> 280: WR Start Script From Tag Number
     <li> 273: WR Start Script From Tag Number 1-Way (activates from first side only)
     <li> 274: W1 Start Script From Tag Number
     <li> 275: W1 Start Script From Tag Number 1-Way (activates from first side only)
     <li> 276: SR Start Script From Tag Number
     <li> 277: S1 Start Script From Tag Number

Like any compiled Small program, the Levelscript may contain scalar global variables
declared as "public." These variables, aside from being normally accessable from any

<a href="small_funcref.html#_GetLevelVar">_GetLevelVar</a> and
<a href="small_funcref.html#_SetLevelVar">_SetLevelVar</a> functions. Using these functions
in your Gamescripts can allow the Gamescript to perform similar actions on many
levels. Note that if a variable is not defined in a particular Levelscript, the Gamescript
executing _GetLevelVar or _SetLevelVar will abort with an error message. The variable must be
defined in each Levelscript in which the Gamescript may attempt to access it.

<b>Savegame Semantics</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
The following subsections contain information on how the Small system behaves when the 
game is saved or loaded.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="OnInit">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>The OnInit Function</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
In the Gamescript, the OnInit function is executed only once at program startup, and therefore
this is not affected by saving or loading games. When a game is loaded, it can be assumed that
the Gamescript OnInit function has already been executed.
<br><br>
In the Levelscript, the OnInit function is executed each time the level is loaded from scratch. 
However, if the level is being initialized during savegame loading, the OnInit function will
NOT be executed, as it is expected that the program state created by it was preserved in the
savegame. Executing it again in that case could create duplicate objects, show unnecessary
messages, etc. Be sure that your OnInit function's changes to the map are saveable or are not
necessary to be repeated after loading a saved game.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="saveglobals">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>Global Variables</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
Global variables declared in both VMs, public or private, will have their values saved in
save games. This means that when a normal game loading action takes place, the values of
global variables in both VMs will instantly change to reflect the state that was in place at
the time of the save.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="localstatics">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>Static Local Variables</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
Static local variables are variables declared inside functions using the <b>static</b> keyword
as opposed to the <b>new</b> keyword. As mentioned in the Small language documentation, static 
local variables, unlike normal local variables, retain their values between calls to the 
function in which they are declared. Because static locals are really just limited-scope 
globals, they are treated the same way, and their values will be saved in savegames.  When a 
normal game loading action takes place, the values of all static local variables in both VMs 
will instantly change to reflect the state that was in place at the time of the save.
<br><br>
Normal local variables are the only storage class of variable that is not archived in save
games. In addition, the status of the Small stack and heap are also not currently saved, since
Eternity does not allow script execution to be interrupted by a save game under any circumstance.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="callbacks">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>Callbacks</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
Callbacks currently scheduled for either VM will be saved in save games. At the time of a normal
load action, any existing callbacks in either VM will be instantly destroyed and will be replaced
with the callbacks which were scheduled at the time of the save.
<br><br>

<p>
<a name="loaderrors">
<hr align="left" width="75%">
<b>Load Errors</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
The following fatal errors may occur while loading a savegame which contains script data under
the given circumstances. Eternity will currently exit if these errors occur.
<ul>
<li> "P_UnArchiveScripts: vm presence inconsistency"
     <br><br>
     The presence of the Gamescript and/or Levelscript has changed since the time of
     the savegame. If a Gamescript or Levelscript is removed from a WAD, but a savegame
     containing its archived image is subsequently loaded, this error will occur. This
     error will also occur if a Gamescript or Levelscript has been added to a WAD and 
     there is no archived image of it in the savegame.
     <br><br>
<li> "P_UnArchiveSmallAMX: data segment consistency error"
     <br><br>
     The size of one or both Small AMX data segments has changed since the time of the
     savegame. This can only occur if a Small script has been recompiled. You cannot
     reload savegames if any of the involved scripts have been recompiled.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="events">
<hr>
<b>System-Defined Event Handlers</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
Complete documentation of all system-defined event handlers is below. System-defined event
handlers are optional functions that you can provide in your script that will be started as
callback scripts by the game engine in response to internal events. If the functions do not
exist, no calls will be issued.

<b>OnInit</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
Required Prototype: public OnInit();<br>
Can Be Defined In: Gamescript, Levelscript
<br><br>
The OnInit function is called when its corresponding virtual machine is initialized. For the
Gamescript, the OnInit function is executed only once at program startup. In the Levelscript, 
the OnInit function is executed each time the level is loaded from scratch, NOT including when
a savegame is being loaded.

<b>OnHUDStart</b>
<hr align="left" width="75%">
</a>
<br>
Required Prototype: public OnHUDStart();<br>
Can Be Defined In: Gamescript, Levelscript
<br><br>
OnHUDStart will be called first in the Gamescript and then in the Levelscript, if defined in
either or both. It is called whenever a new level is started, or when the player being
displayed by the game engine changes. Because text widgets are cleared by default, you may
want to set new values to them in this function. You may also use it to maintain the internal
state of your scripts with respect to the HUD.

<br>
Required Prototype: public OnHUDPreDraw();<br>
Can Be Defined In: Gamescript, Levelscript
<br><br>
OnHUDPreDraw will be called first in the Gamescript and then in the Levelscript, if defined in
either or both. It is called once per frame after HUD widgets from the previous frame have
been erased, but before drawing of widgets for the current frame has begun. This is the safest
time to alter the properties of HUD widgets. Altering properties such as location or graphic
being shown at any other time may result in visual artifacts. Call functions such as
<a href="small_funcref.html#_MoveWidget">_MoveWidget</a> from this event handler.
