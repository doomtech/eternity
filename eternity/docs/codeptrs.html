<b>The Eternity Engine Definitive Code Pointer Reference -- 06/17/05</b>
<hr>

<p>
<a href="../etcengine.html">Return to the Eternity Engine Page</a>

<p>
This is a reference that should be of value to DeHackEd patch authors.
It exposes full information on all the code pointers available in
the Eternity Engine, including both those from DOOM and those added in
later ports. This reference attempts to expose all issues related to
their use, as well as common pitfalls that lead to nasty crashes.

<b>General Pitfall and Note on the Type Information:</b>
<hr width="60%" align="left"></a>

<p>
General code pointers can be used in any frame that is not a player gun frame.
Player Gun Frame code pointers cannot be used anywhere except in player gun
frames. If a code pointer is used in the wrong type of frame, the internal 
function call stack will be corrupted, a "Segmentation Violation" error will 
most likely occur, and Cyberdemons will come to get you in the night. This
isn't an Eternity bug or limitation. This problem would eventually manifest
itself even in the original doom.exe, as a sudden, unexplained Venetian Blinds
crash. There is additionally no way to type-check codepointers at run-time,
so the user must accept this responsibility.

<p>
Note that as of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, there is a special
codepointer called PlayerThunk, usable via EDF, which allows player gun frames
to call a select set of monster codepointers by proxy.

<p>
Parameterized pointers take parameters via fields on the frame in which they
are used. The code pointer parameter information will indicate what fields are
used as parameters, and what parameter values mean.

<a name="damage"><hr width="40%" align="left">
<b>Note on Damage Formulae:</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<p>
Most damage in DOOM uses a random number, a modulus value, and a multiplier.
In general, damage formulae will appear like this:

<p>
(rnd%modulus + 1) * multiplier

<p>
where rnd is a random number between 0 and 255, unless otherwise noted.

<p>
(rnd%modulus) + 1 results in a range of numbers from 1 to modulus, so
if the following formula is shown:

<p>
(rnd%8 + 1) * 3

<p>
then the range of damage values is multiples of 3 from 3 to 24, since
1*3 = 3 and 8*3 = 24. Where damage values involve the summation of several
random "dice" throws or other, more complicated formulae, the damage range
will be shown explicitly for convenience.

<b>Weapon Maintenance Pointers</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<ul>
<li> <b>Light0</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Turns off any lighting flashes caused by firing a weapon.
     <br>
     <br>
<li> <b>Light1</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Causes a first-level light flash to occur for the player
              shooting the weapon.<br>
     Notes:   Weapon flashes do not function on levels that use special
              global colormaps. Light must be subsequently returned to
              normal by using the Light0 code pointer above.
     <br><br><br>
     
     
<li> <b>Light2</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Causes a second-level light flash to occur for the player
              shooting the weapon.<br>
     Notes:   Weapon flashes do not function on levels that use special
              global colormaps. Light must be subsequently returned to
              normal by using the Light0 code pointer above.
     <br><br><br>
     
       
<li> <b>WeaponReady</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Readies a weapon for firing or change, should be used after
              the weapon's raise sequence and fire sequence.
     <br><br><br>
     
     
<li> <b>Lower</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Lowers the current weapon and changes to a newly selected one,
              unless the player is dead. Should be called from the weapon's
              lowering sequence.
     <br><br><br>  
     
     
<li> <b>Raise</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Raises a new weapon to normal position. Should be called from
              a weapon's raise sequence.
     <br><br><br>
     
     
<li> <b>ReFire</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Allows a weapon to restart its firing sequence without returning
              to its ready sequence. If the player does not have enough ammo
              to fire again, the weapon will be lowered and replaced.
     <br><br><br>      
     
     
<li> <b>CheckReload</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Checks the ammo for a weapon to see if a weapon change should
              occur before the reload frames are entered. Used in particular
              by the super shotgun.<br>
     Notes:   This code pointer does not function properly in BOOM, MBF, or
              SMMU, and will fail to make the weapon lower before completing
              its reload frames. This problem has been repaired in Eternity.
     <br><br><br>      
     
     
<li> <b>GunFlash</b><br>
     Type:    Weapon maintenance, normal<br>
     Purpose: Allows weapon kickback to be synchronized with the gun's firing
              frames as opposed to when the player presses the trigger. This
              code pointer is new as of BOOM, and is used by the BFG so that
              kickback does not occur until after BFG delay. It would work
              for any weapon with a similar firing delay. Should be called
              from one of the weapon's firing frames.

<a name="pap"><hr width="40%" align="left">
<b>Player Attack Pointers</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<ul>
<li> <b>Punch</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Performs the standard player punch attack. Hits for damage with
           the formula (rnd%10 + 1) * 2 when the player is normal. If the
           player is berserk, this value is multiplied by 10. The player can
           only hit when within melee range (64 units). If a hit is successful,
           the player will turn to directly face the target and will emit the
           "punch" sound effect.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>FirePistol</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires a single bullet for standard player tracer damage --
           (rnd%3 + 1) * 5 -- Accuracy will be perfect on the first shot, but
           will use "never" accuracy if the gun is fired repeatedly. The player
           object will transfer to its second attack frame when this pointer is 
           used. The player will emit the "pistol" sound effect.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FireShotgun</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires player shotgun attack. Seven tracers are fired using "never"
           accuracy (a moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error), each
           doing standard bullet damage of (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. The player object
           will transfer to its second attack frame when this pointer is used.
           The player will emit the "shotgn" sound effect.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>FireShotgun2</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires player super shotgun attack. Twenty tracers are fired using
           "ssg" accuracy (wide horizontal spread combined with moderate 
           vertical error), each tracer doing standard bullet damage of
           (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. The player object will transfer to its second
           attack state, and will emit the "dshtgn" sound effect.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FireCGun</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires player chaingun attack. Fires one tracer for standard bullet
           damage of (rnd%3 + 1) * 5. Accuracy will be perfect on the first
           shot, but will use "never" accuracy on subsequent shots. The player 
           object will transfer to its second attack state, and will emit the 
           "chgun" sound effect.<br>
  Notes:   If no DSCHGUN sound lump is present amongst all WAD files, the "chgun"
           sound effect will be dynamically remapped to DSPISTOL. This behavior
           is new as of SMMU.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FireMissile</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires a single RocketShot projectile.
<br><br><br>
  
<li> <b>Saw</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Performs a player chainsaw attack. Hits for (rnd%10 + 1) * 2 damage
           once per call. Player must be within melee range + 1 unit (65 units)
           in order to hit with this attack. If the attack misses, the player
           will emit the "sawful" sound effect. If the attack hits, the player
           will emit the "sawhit" sound effect, and his/her current angle will
           be set directly toward the target, and then will be randomly 
           deflected 4.5 degrees to the right or left. The JUSTATTACKED flag 
           will be set for the player object, causing slight forward movement.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FirePlasma</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires a single PlasmaShot projectile. Has a 50% chance of causing 
           the weapon to stall by entering its reload state after firing.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FireBFG</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Fires a single BFGShot projectile.

<ul>           
<li> <b>BFGsound</b><br>
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Player object will emit the "bfg" sound.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>OpenShotgun2</b><br>
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Player object will emit the "dbopn" sound effect.
<br><br><br>
  
<li> <b>LoadShotgun2</b><br>
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Player object will emit the "dbload" sound effect.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>CloseShotgun2</b><br>
  Type:    Weapon miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Player object will emit the "dbcls" sound effect, and then control
           will transfer to the ReFire code pointer, which will check for
           weapon refire.

<a name="ppap"><hr width="40%" align="left">
<b>Parameterized Player Attack Pointers</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<ul>           
<li> <b>FireCustomBullets</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
  <li> Args2 = Select accuracy type (default of 0 = 1)
            <ul>
            <li> 1 = Always accurate
            <li> 2 = Accurate on first fire only ("never" accurate afterward)
            <li> 3 = Never accurate<br> 
                  (moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error)
            <li> 4 = Super Shotgun accuracy<br>
                  (wide horizontal spread with moderate vertical error)
            <li> 5 = Monster accuracy (very wide horizontal spread)
            </ul>
  <li> Args3 = Number of bullet tracers to fire (default of 0 = 0)
  <li> Args4 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  <li> Args5 = Damage modulus<br>
            (Clamped into range of 1 to 256)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Extremely powerful codepointer that allows construction of custom
           player bullet weapons. The sound, accuracy, number of tracers, and
           randomized damage range of the tracers are all selectable via the
           argument fields of the frame calling this codepointer. It is
           possible to recreate any of the other bullet attacks in the game
           using this pointer, as well as create many totally new ones.<br>
           New to Eternity.<br>
  Notes:   The Args1 parameter has been changed as of EE v3.31 public beta 5
           to use a sound DeHackEd number as defined via EDF.  This allows
           this pointer to use any sound, including those defined in user
           EDF files.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FirePlayerMissile</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, Homing missile firing pointer, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd Number of thing type to shoot (must be valid, no default)
  <li> Args2 = Select homing property (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = will not home
            <li> 1 = may home
            </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>          
  Purpose: Allows a custom player projectile attack. The type of missile to
           fire is given as the thing type's DeHackEd number in Args1. If this
           type is invalid, this codepointer does nothing. If Args2 is set to
           1 and the missile fired has a homing maintenance codepointer in its
           frames, the missile will home on the player's current autoaiming
           target, if one exists. New to Eternity.<br>
  Notes:   A missile cannot home unless its frames contain a homing maintenance
           codepointer. These pointers include:
           <ul>
           <li> Tracer
           <li> GenTracer
           <li> HticTracer
           <li> WhirlwindSeek
           </ul>
<br><br>
           
<li> <b>CustomPlayerMelee</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  <li> Args2 = Damage modulus (Clamped into range of 1 to 256)
  <li> Args3 = Berserk multiplier (default 0, x*damage when player is berserk)
  <li> Args4 = Select angle deflection type (default of 0 = 1)
            <ul>
            <li> 1 = None
            <li> 2 = Punch (player will face object on hit)
            <li> 3 = Chainsaw (player will face object and be wiggled around)
            </ul>
  <li> Args5 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
  </ul>
  <br>          
  Purpose: Extremely powerful codepointer that allows construction of custom
           player melee attacks. Two major classes of attacks are possible,
           punch-style and chainsaw-style, depending on the parameters given.
           Note that the Berserk multiplier can be applied to any attack,
           but that if it is 0, you will do zero damage when berserk! The
           Berserk multiplier should be 1 when no berserk bonus is desired.<br>
           New to Eternity.<br>
  Notes:   The Args5 parameter has been changed as of EE v3.31 public beta 5
           to use a sound DeHackEd number as defined via EDF.  This allows
           this pointer to use any sound, including those defined in user

<li> <b>PlayerThunk</b><br>
  Type:    Player attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Codepointer to call (no default, must be valid)
  <li> Args2 = Select target facing behavior (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = FaceTarget pointer has no effect
            <li> 1 = FaceTarget pointer is active
            </ul>
  <li> Args3 = DeHackEd number of state to put player in temporarily 
            (default of 0 = 0; negative value = no state change)
  <li> Args4 = Select targeting behavior (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = Player targets last attacker, if any
            <li> 1 = Player targets current autoaim target, if any<br>
                  (attack fails if none)
            </ul>
  <li> Args5 = Select ammo usage (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = No ammo is used
            <li> 1 = Normal amount of ammo is used, if applicable
                  (see note below about autoaim targeting)
            </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>                            
  Purpose: Allows player gun frames to call a select set of monster code-
           pointers which have been determined as safe for use in this
           context. If the index parameter indicates an invalid codepointer,
           or any of the other parameters have invalid values, nothing
           will occur. New to Eternity.<br>
           <br>
  Notes:   If targeting behavior is set to autoaim, and ammo usage is on, no 
           ammo is used unless the player follows through with an attack on 
           his current target. Otherwise, ammo would be used despite no attack 
           occuring. This may become an additional ammo usage option in the 
           future.<br>
           <br>
           Behavior of monster codepointers when applied to the player will
           in general be exactly as described for monsters. The Args3 field 
           is provided for use with parameterized codepointers, so that they 
           can retrieve args values from a different frame. The player will 
           NOT display a sprite, call an action function, or cause a particle
           event from this state.<br>
           <br>
           *** The Args3 parameter's behavior has been changed slightly as
           of EE v3.31 public beta 5. Formerly, the default value zero meant
           no state change would occur, but this was inappropriate. Now, a
           negative number means no state, and zero means whatever state
           is defined to have DeHackEd number zero (S_NULL by default).

<ul>
<li> <b>BFGSpray</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes BFG explosion effects, which differ depending upon the
           player's selected type of BFG:
           <ol>
           <li>Normal BFG:<br>
              40 tracers will emanate from the object which fired the
              projectile in the general direction in which the projectile
              was fired, each doing damage that is the sum of 15 rolls of
              an 8-sided die (Absolute damage range per tracer is 15 to 120, 
              absolute damage range of ALL tracers is 600 to 4800).
           <li>BFG 11K:<br>
              Control is transferred to the BFG11KHit codepointer
           <li>Bouncing BFG:<br>
              Control is transferred to the BouncingBFG codepointer
           <li>Plasma Burst BFG:<br>
              Control is transferred to the BFGBurst codepointer
           </ol>
<br><br>

<li> <b>BFG11KHit</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Explosion effect of BFG 11k weapon. Designed for more balanced play
           in deathmatch, this BFG works very differently. First, if the BFG
           ball explodes closer than 96 units to its originator, the originator
           will take damage proportional to that distance. The damage
           calculation is the sum of floor(48 - (distance / 2)) rolls of an 
           8-sided die. At 95 units away, the damage is 0. At 0 units away, the
           damage ranges from 48 to 384. The originator is hit directly for
           this damage, and a BFGFlash object is spawned at his/her location.
           40 tracers will be fired out in a circular pattern from the 
           explosion location. These tracers cannot hit the originator of the
           missile. These tracers will hit for damage equal to the sum of 20
           rolls of an 8-sided die (damage range per tracer is 20 to 160, 
           damage range of all tracers together is 800 to 6400). When a target
           is hit, an BFGFlash object will be spawned at its location.<br>
           New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>           

<li> <b>BouncingBFG</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Explosion effect of Bouncing BFG weapon. This BFG does not do any
           tracer-based damage. Instead, 40 test traces are fired in a circular
           pattern from the point of explosion. The first of these tracers to
           hit a living object selects that object as the target. If the same
           object was targetted just prior in this weapon's propagation
           process, it will not be targetted again and the process will stop.
           If this is the 16th time the process has repeated, the process
           will also stop. If a valid target is acquired, a new BFGShot 
           projectile will be fired from the current projectile's location 
           toward the target. This bouncing can occur up to 16 times, as noted 
           before. New to Eternity.<br>
  Notes:   This effect will not work unless the original projectile was
           fired by the FireBFG player gun codepointer.
<br><br>    <br>       
           
<li> <b>BFGBurst</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Explosion effect of the Plasma Burst BFG weapon. This BFG does not
           do tracer-based damage. Instead, 40 EEBetaPlasma3 projectiles will 
           be fired from the point of explosion in a circular pattern, with
           randomized small positive or negative z momentum, such that they
           tend to bounce off the floor. The new projectiles cannot hit the
           originator of the BFG projectile. Based on the BFG from the
           unreleased MagDOOM source port by Cephaler.<br>
           New to Eternity.

<li> <b>Mushroom</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Fixed-point launch angle factor (default of 0 = 4 units)
  <li> Unknown 2 = Fixed-point missile momentum factor (default of 0 = 1/2 unit)
  <li> Args1     = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn (default of 0 = MancubusShot)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Causes a mushroom cloud effect. The object will first call the
           Explode codepointer for primary blast radius damage. Then, a
           number of MancubusShot projectiles proportional to the object's
           missile damage field will be launched into the air in a circular 
           pattern, using the angle and speed parameters provided in the 
           current frame. This codepointer is new to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   The Args1 parameter is new to Eternity Engine v3.31 beta 4. It
           allows the thing type fired to be overridden. If this parameter
           is not provided, the default MancubusShot will be used.
           <br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Nailbomb</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes a blast radius attack with radius and max damage value of
           128, and then fires 30 bullet tracers in a circular spread for
           10 damage each. New to SMMU.
           <br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>SetFlags</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Select Bits Field (no default)
            <ul>
            <li> 1 = Bits
            <li> 2 = Bits2
            <li> 3 = Bits3
            </ul>
  <li> Args2 = Value to Logical-OR with selected Bits field (default of 0 = 0)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Adds the flags set in Args2 to the object's Bits field
           selected by Args1. This "turns on" effects controlled by those
           bits. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>           
           
<li> <b>UnSetFlags</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Select Bits Field (no default)
             <ul>
             <li> 1 = Bits
             <li> 2 = Bits2
             <li> 3 = Bits3
             </ul>
  <li> Args2 = Value to Inverse-Logical-AND with selected Bits field 
            (default of 0 = 0)
  </ul>
  <br>            
  Purpose: Removes the flags set in Args2 from the object's Bits field 
           selected by Args1. This "turns off" effects controlled by those
           bits. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>Fall</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Removes the solid flag from the object, allowing it to be walked
           over.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Die</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to die by damaging it for its current health.
           This codepointer is new to MBF.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>BrainScream</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Boss Brain Explosion. Spawns RocketShot objects from the point
           (object.x - 196, object.y - 320, z) to the point
           (object.x + 320, object.y - 320, z), stepping 8 units along the
           x axis for each spawn, and using a random z coordinate of
           128 + (rnd * 2). Each RocketShot object will be given a random
           z momentum of (512 * rnd), will be set to frame S_BRAINEXPLODE1
           (#799), and will have its state's length modified by a random 
           amount of 0 to 7 gametics, not allowing the frame length to be 
           less than 1 tic. The object will then play the "bosdth" sound 
           effect at full volume.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>BrainExplode</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Boss Brain Explosion, called by rockets spawned by BrainScream.
           Another RocketShot object will be spawned within a small distance
           of the one calling this pointer, and it will be given randomized
           z momentum, be transferred to frame S_BRAINEXPLODE1 (#799), and 
           have its frame's length randomly modified.<br>
  Notes:   This effect will continue ad infinitum. This may slow the game
           down eventually, especially if multiple objects start this
           effect.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>SpawnFly</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Boss spawn cube spawning function. If the spawn cube has not
           reached its target spot, which is judged by a precomputed amount
           of time having passed, nothing will occur. Otherwise, a 
           BossSpawnFire object will be spawned at the object's (x,y) location
           on the floor of its sector, the "telept" sound will be played, and 
           one of the following monsters will be spawned at the same point, 
           with the approximate probability listed for that type:
           
           <pre>
                   Type     Probability   Type number (*)
           * DoomImp --------- 19.5% --------  1
           * Demon ----------- 15.6% --------  2
           * Spectre --------- 11.7% --------  3
           * Cacodemon ------- 11.7% --------  5
           * Mancubus -------- 11.7% --------  9
           * HellKnight ------  9.3% -------- 10
           * Arachnotron -----  7.8% --------  8
           * PainElemental ---  3.9% --------  4
           * Revenant --------  3.9% --------  7
           * BaronOfHell -----  3.9% -------- 11
           * Archvile --------  0.7% --------  6</pre>
           
           Friendliness of the spawn cube object will be transferred to the
           spawned monster. The spawned monster will telefrag anything
           occupying its location. The spawned monster will immediately
           awaken if it can either see a target, or a target has made sound
           in the area at any time in the past. The spawn cube object will
           remove itself after the spawning operation takes place.<br>
  Notes:   Spawn cubes can occasionally miss their target. This is due to
           round-off error in the calculation used to determine the amount
           of time the cube should travel. If this happens, the cube will
           travel in a straight path for an undetermined amount of time.
           (*) -- This number indicates the order of the thing types in the
           EDF boss_spawner_types list. EDF allows the thing types spawned
           by this codepointer to be edited. See the <a href="edf_ref.html">EDF Reference</a>
           for more information.
<br><br><br>
                      
<li> <b>Fire</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Moves the object in front of the object it is tracing, if the
           object which it was spawned by has not lost sight of the traced
           object. This object must have been spawned by the VileAttack
           codepointer or no effects will occur.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Spawn</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn <br>
                (must be valid, no default)
  <li> Unknown 2 = Integer amount of units to add to z coordinate of object <br>
                (default = 0)  
  </ul>
  <br>              
  Purpose: Spawns an object of the provided type at the calling object's
           location. Friendliness of the calling object will be transferred
           to the spawned object. This codepointer is new to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   This codepointer will no longer crash on invalid thing type numbers
           as of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3. If the type indicated is
           not valid, the pointer will do nothing. Also note that if both the 
           source and spawned object are solid, they will become stuck to each
           other. This codepointer is more suitable for boss-brain-like 
           effects.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Turn</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Integer number of degrees to turn (default of 0 = 0 degrees)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: The object will turn from its present angle the provided number
           of degrees. New to MBF.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Face</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Integer angle to face (default of 0 = 0 degrees)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Makes the object face toward the indicated angle. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   0 (zero) degrees is equivalent to east, or toward the right
           side of the automap.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>LineEffect</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Line special (default of 0 = 0)
  <li> Unknown 2 = Sector tag (default of 0 = 0)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Allows objects to trigger linedef specials from frames.
           This effect can trigger any W1/WR/S1/SR line effect. It does
           not work for G1/GR line effects. If a W1 or S1 line effect
           is triggered, the object will not be able to trigger any
           additional line effects. If the line special provided is not
           a valid type, nothing will occur. Note that the action will
           occur as if a player has activated the line, and not a
           monster. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta, this codepointer cannot
           cause accidental corruption of memory under any circumstances.
           While exceedingly rare, this could have occurred occasionally
           in MBF and SMMU.<br>
  Warning: This codepointer may cause undesired side effects in some
           situations by affecting the first line defined in the map
           and/or the sector(s) which it references. Use with caution!
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>Stop</b><br>

  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of object type to spawn (must be valid, no default)
  <li> Args2 = Fixed-point amount of z momentum to apply to object<br>

  Purpose: Teleport glitter spawning function. Can be used to make a fountain
           of any type of object. One object will be spawned at a randomized
           coordinate within a square around the source object, and will be 
           given z momentum specified in Args2. If the thing type given
           in Args1 is invalid, this codepointer will do nothing.<br>
           Parameters 3 and 4 are new to Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta.<br>
           New to Eternity.

<li> <b>AccelGlitter</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Accelerates the object upward by increasing its z momentum by 50%.<br>
           New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>SpawnAbove</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to spawn (must be valid, no default)
  <li> Args2 = Frame DeHackEd number to which thing will transfer<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no frame transfer)
  <li> Args3 = Integer amount to add to thing's z coordinate<br>
            (default of 0 = 0 units)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Special spawning function to spawn an object above the source
           object. The object will be spawned at precisely the source's (x,y)
           position, and at the object's z coordinate plus the amount provided 
           in Args3. It will then be set to the frame specified by Args2, if 
           any. If the thing type in Args1 or the frame number in Args2 are 
           invalid, the pointer will do nothing. Note that a negative value can 
           be provided for the frame number to indicate that no frame
           transition is to take place. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>MummySoul</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Spawns a GolemSoul object 10 units above the object and gives it
           upward momentum of 1 unit. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>BlueSpark</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Spawns D'Sparil's blue projectile spark trail. Two DsparilSpark
           objects are spawned at the object's location and are given 
           randomized x, y, and z momenta. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>GenWizard</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: DsparilShot2 Disciple spawning pointer. The pointer will attempt to 
           spawn a Disciple object at its (x,y) location and at its z minus 1/2 
           the height of a Disciple object. If after spawning, the object does 
           not fit or cannot move, it will be removed from the level immediate-
           ly. Otherwise, the MBF friendliness flag will be transferred from the
           source object to the new object, the source object will be stopped
           and set to its death state, a HereticTeleFog object will be spawned 
           at its location, and the Heretic TELEPT sound effect will be played.<br>
           New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>Sor2DthInit</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Part of D'Sparil (2nd form) death sequence. The object's Counter 0
           field will be set to 7 so that the death frame sequence loops 7
           times, and all living entities with the same friendliness as the
           dying object will be massacred (that is, if a friendly D'Sparil
           dies, all friends die, and if an enemy D'Sparil dies, all enemies
           die). New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>Sor2DthLoop</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Part of D'Sparil (2nd form) death sequence. Each call to this
           codepointer decrements Counter 0 field set by Sor2DthInit by
           one. If the field is still greater than zero, nothing will happen.
           Otherwise, the object will be transferred to the S_SOR2_DIE4
           frame and the death loop ends. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>PodPain</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Called when pods are damaged. There is a 50% chance that this
           codepointer will do nothing. Provided it takes action, there is
           a 16/256 chance that the codepointer will perform its action
           twice rather than once. Depending upon whether it chooses once
           or twice, it will spawn one or two PodGoo objects at the source
           object's (x,y) location and its z + 48 units. The objects will
           be given randomized momenta away from the pod. New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>RemovePod</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: Part of pod generator code, called when a pod is destroyed. This
           codepointer uses an internal field of the object to find the pod
           generator which spawned this pod. If that field is valid, it will
           decrement the PodGenerator's Counter 0 field so that the generator 
           will be able to spawn more pods in the future.<br>
           New to Eternity.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>MakePod</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal
  Purpose: Part of pod generator code, called by pod generators to spawn pods.
           The object's Counter 0 field is used to track the number of pods
           currently owned by this generator. If that number is higher than 16,
           no more pods will be spawned (this limit is necessary to avoid
           overcrowding of areas with pods). Provided that there are not too
           many pods, the generator will attempt to create a new Pod object 
           at its location. If the generator's location is blocked by a solid 
           object, the pod will be removed immediately. Otherwise, the pod 
           object will transfer to the S_POD_GROW1 frame and will emit the
           Heretic NEWPOD sound effect. It will then be given random momenta,
           and one of its internal fields will be set to point back to the
           pod generator so that the generator can later be notified of the 
           pod's destruction. New to Eternity.

<br><br><br>
<li> <b>DripBlood</b><br>
  Type:    Miscellaneous, normal<br>
  Purpose: A HereticBlood object will be spawned at a random location within a
           small distance of the source object, will be given randomized x and 
           y momenta, and will be given the LOGRAV Bits2 flag. New to Eternity.

  Type:    Miscellaneous / sound, normal<br>
  Purpose: The object's Counter 0 field will be set to 20, so that it will
           walk faster when using the Sor1Chase codepointer. Control will then

<ul>
<li> <b>PlaySound</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Sound DeHackEd number to play (must be valid, no default)
  <li> Unknown 2 = Select sound volume
                <ul>
                <li> 0 = normal (default)

                </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>                
  Purpose: Causes the object to emit the sound indicated by the provided
           sound DeHackEd number, at the indicated volume level. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer will
           no longer crash the game if an invalid sound number is provided.
           If the sound number is invalid, nothing will happen.
<br><br><br>           
           
<li> <b>Pain</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays the object's pain sound, if it has one.
  <br><br><br>
  
<li> <b>Scream</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays the object's death sound, if it has one. If the object uses
           certain sounds as its death sound, it may play one of a set of
           random sounds as documented here:
           <ol>
           <li> If the object uses any of the "podth1", "podth2", or "podth3"
              sounds, it will play one of the three sounds at random.
           <li> If the object uses either of the "bgdth1" or "bgdth2" sounds,
              it will play one of the two sounds at random.
           </ol>
           If the object has the BOSS flag in its Bits2 field, it will play
           its death sound at full volume. This is used by most DOOM and
           Heretic bosses.
<br><br><br>
  
<li> <b>XScream</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays the "slop" sound. If the object is a player, falling damage
           is active, and the player has died from falling, the "fallht"
           sound will be played (this sound is subject to remapping by
           player skins).
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>PlayerScream</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays player death sounds. Normally plays "pldeth" sound. However,
           in games other than the shareware game, if the player dies with
           -50 or less health, it will play the "pdiehi" sound. If Eternity's
           falling damage effect is active, and the player has died from
           falling, the "fallht" sound will be played. Note that all of these
           sounds are subject to remapping by player skins.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>BrainPain</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays the "bospn" sound effect at full volume.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>BrainAwake</b><br>
  Type:    Object sound pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Plays the "bossit" sound effect at full volume.<br>
  Notes:   In DOOM, this codepointer was also responsible for initializing the
           internal list of Boss Spawn Spot objects. If the number of objects
           was incorrect, this code pointer could crash the game. However, this
           behavior has been moved, as of BOOM, to an internal level init
           function, and the limit on spawn spots has also been removed.
<br><br><br>

<b>AI Pointers</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<ul>
<li> <b>Look</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to look for targets. Various gameplay elements
           have an effect on acquiring a target. Friendly monsters will look
           for enemies first, but if they find none, will look for a player to
           follow. Enemies will look for players first, then friendly monsters.
           If none are found, they will remain asleep. Upon waking, a monster
           will play its alert sound. Use of certain alert sounds by a monster
           will cause it to randomly use one of a set of sounds, as documented
           here:
           <ol>
           <li> If object uses the "posit1", "posit2", or "posit3" sounds, it
              will use any one of these three sounds at random.
           <li> If object uses the "bgsit1" or "bgsit2" sounds, it will use one
              of these two sounds at random.
           </ol>
           If the object has the BOSS flag in its Bits2 field, it will play its
           alert sound at full-volume. This is used by most DOOM and Heretic
           bosses by default. After playing the sound, the object will transfer
           to its "first walking" state.<br>
  Notes:   This codepointer should only be called from an object's initial
           spawn state. Calling it from a walking state can cause an infinite
           state cycle, which will cause an error message to appear.
           <br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Chase</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes an object to pursue its target.
           <br><br>
           <ul>
           <li> If the object has lost its target (ie. it has died or been 
             removed), the object will look for a new target (possibly 
             remembering a prior one). If no targets are found, the object will
             return to its initial spawn state.
             <br><br>
           <li> If the object has a target, it may attempt to attack: 
             <br><br>
             <ul>
             <li> If an object has just attacked prior to this, it will not attack
               again, unless the game skill is at "Nightmare!" level or is in 
               "fast" mode. Instead, the enemy will choose a new direction to 
               walk in. 
             <br><br>
             <li> If the object has a melee attack and is within 64 units of its 
               target, it will transfer to its melee attack state.<br><br>
             <li> If the object does not have a melee attack or is not close 
               enough to use it, is within normal missile range (2048 units),
               and timing or skill level permitting, it will transfer to its
               missile attack state.
             </ul>
               <br>
           <li> Depending on the actor's internal "threshold" value, which 
             decrements slowly as it chases a target, it may choose a new 
             target to attack when it cannot attack its current one. 
             <br><br>
             <ul>
             <li> Friendly objects may choose a new player to follow, or may 
               look for other friendly objects who are in critical condition 
               (low health). If a friendly object finds a friend in trouble, 
               it may adopt that friend's target as its own. 
             <br><br>
             <li> Enemies will look for new players first, and then friendly 
               monsters. If advanced strafing logic is active, and the monster
               is moving, it may decide to strafe away from its target. 
             </ul>
               <br>
           <li> Once all moving and attack logic has been passed, the object has a
             3/256 (1.17%) chance of playing its active (roaming) sound, if it
             has one.
             <br><br>
             <ul>
             <li> If an object has the ACTSEESOUND flag in its Bits3 field, it has
               a 50% chance of playing its alert sound instead of its active 
               sound. 
             <br><br>
             <li> If an object has the LOUDACTIVE flag in its Bits3 field, it will
               play which ever sound it chooses at full volume.
             </ul>
           </ul>
           <br>  
  Notes:   This codepointer should only be called from the walking frames of a
           sentient object. There may be undesired effects or undefined
           behavior in other circumstances. 
           <br><br>
           As of Eternity Engine v3.33.01, this codepointer will not crash the
           game if used in an object's spawn state or attack states. However, an 
           error message may be printed until the object leaves the offending state(s),
           as using the pointer in this context is NOT appropriate.
           <br><br><br>    
           
<li> <b>VileChase</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes an object to look for monster corpses as it walks. When a
           corpse is encountered which has a resurrection state, is currently
           in a frame with a -1 tics value, and is not currently blocked by 
           any other creature, the object will stop beside it and transfer to 
           frame #266 (S_VILE_HEAL). The object being resurrected will emit the
           DSSLOP sound and will be placed into its first resurrection frame. 
           The resurrected object's normal height, radius, health, and flags 
           information will be restored. Friendliness of the object performing
           the resurrection will be transferred to the resurrected object 
           (friendly objects resurrect friends, and vice versa). If no corpses
           are found to resurrect, control transfers to the Chase codepointer 
           for normal attack and walking logic.<br>
  Notes:   If comp_vile is set, crushed creatures will not have their height
           or radius information restored, and will become "ghosts."
           <br><br><br>

<li> <b>FaceTarget</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Makes an object face its target, if it has one. If the object's
           target is partially invisible (Bits field SHADOW), totally
           invisible (Bits2 field DONTDRAW), or a Heretic ghost (Bits3 field
           GHOST), the object will face toward the target, and then have a
           random amount between -45 and 45 degrees added to its angle.
           <br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>KeepChasing</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Allows a monster to keep walking during its attack frames. Chase cannot
           be used in this context because it may cause the monster to acquire a 
           new target while trying to attack its current one. Note the monster's
           attack frames will need to have a short duration for the motion to seem
           smooth. New to Eternity.
           <br><br><br>

<li> <b>RandomWalk</b><br>
  Type:    AI pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes an object to walk around in randomly chosen directions, whether it
           has no target or has acquired a target via being damaged. Neither friends
           nor enemies using this pointer will follow the player at any time. This
           pointer has a 24/256 chance of setting the object back to its spawn state
           once movement in one direction has stopped. If the spawn state doesn't
           call RandomWalk, this allows the object to periodically stop movement. It
           is possible for a thing using RandomWalk to transfer to use of normal AI
           via Look and Chase, but note that if a thing using RandomWalk walks into
           a sector where alerting sound has occurred at any time during gameplay, it 
           would awaken instantly if the Look pointer was then used. Things using this
           pointer will not continue to walk into obstructions, but will choose a
           different random direction in which to walk. Things using this pointer
           never attack while walking, though it is possible to set up retaliatory
           attacks from a thing's other states, such as the pain state, in concert 
           with the TargetJump codepointer.<br>

           has been set to a positive value by the Sor1Pain codepointer, the 
           object will subtract 3 from its current tics value, causing it to 
           walk faster (its tics value will not be set less than 1, to avoid 
           state cycles). The Counter 0 field will be decremented by 1. Control
           then transfers to the Chase codepointer for normal walking logic.<br>

<ul>
<li> <b>PosAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes a Zombieman pistol attack. If the object's target is valid,
           it will turn to face it, play the "pistol" sound effect, and fire
           a single tracer with "monster" accuracy (very wide horizontal
           spread) for standard monster tracer damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>SPosAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes a Sergeant shotgun attack. If the object's target is valid,
           it will turn to face it, play the "shotgn" sound effect, and fire
           3 tracers with "monster" accuracy for standard monster tracer
           damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>VileTarget</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to face its target, and spawns a VileFire 
           object at the target's location. The Fire codepointer will be called
           on the VileFire object after it is spawned.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>VileAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and can currently be seen by the
           object, an Archvile explosion attack will occur. The object will
           face its target, emit the "barexp" sound, and damage the object
           directly for 20 points of damage. This attack will also impart
           an upward velocity to the target of (1000 / mass) units per tic.
           If the object has a currently spawned VileFire object, that object 
           will emit a blast radius of 70 units, with maximum damage of 70 at 
           the center of the explosion. This explosion can damage the attacking
           object if it is not immune to blast radius damage.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>SkelFist</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and is within melee range
           (64 units) of the object, it will face its target, emit the 
           DSSKEPCH sound and damage its target directly for

<li> <b>SkelMissile</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, Homing missile firing pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face toward it and fire
           a TracerShot missile at it. The missile's tracer target will be set
           the to the object it was fired at.<br>
  Notes:   Missiles fired by this pointer will be fired 16 units higher than
           the normal default of 32 units.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FatAttack1</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it, and then turn an
           additional +11.25 degrees. It will fire two MancubusShot missiles, 
           one directly at the target, and another at +11.25 degrees.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FatAttack2</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it, and then turn an
           additional -11.25 degrees. It will fire two MancubusShot missiles, 
           one directly at the target, and another at -11.25 degrees.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>FatAttack3</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack normal<br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid, it will face it and fire two
           MancubusShot missiles, one at its angle plus 5.625 degrees, and
           the other at its angle minus 5.625 degrees.
<br><br><br>

<li> <b>CPosAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Causes a Chaingunner chaingun attack. If the object's target is 
           valid, it will turn to face it, play the "chgun" sound effect, and
           fire a single tracer with "monster" accuracy (very wide horizontal
           spread) for standard monster tracer damage of (rnd%5 + 1) * 3.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>TroopAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Imp attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it will
           face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units) of
           the object, the object will emit the "claw" sound effect and damage
           the target directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 3 damage. Otherwise, the
           object will fire a DoomImpShot projectile at the target.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>SargAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Demon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid and is
           within melee range (64 units) of the target, it will face the
           target and damage it directly for (rnd%10 + 1) * 4 damage.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>HeadAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Cacodemon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it
           will face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units)
           of the object, the object will damage the target directly for
           (rnd%6 + 1) * 10 damage. Otherwise, the object will fire a
           CacodemonShot projectile at the target.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>BruisAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Baron attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it will
           face toward it. If the target is within melee range (64 units) of
           the object, the object will emit the "claw" sound effect, and will
           damage the target directly for (rnd%8 + 1) * 10 damage. Otherwise,
           the object will fire a BaronShot projectile at the target.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>SkullAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Lost soul attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid, it
           will face toward it and, if it has an attack sound, will emit it.
           The object's SKULLFLY Bits flag will be set, and it will hurdle
           toward its target at a speed of 20 units per second.
  Notes:   Eternity will not crash if an object with no attack sound uses
           this codepointer. This was a common problem in earlier ports.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>BspiAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Arachnotron attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it and fire one ArachnotronShot projectile.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>CyberAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Cyberdemon attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it and fire one RocketShot projectile.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>PainAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Pain Elemental attack codepointer. If the object's target is valid,
           it will face toward it. If the comp_pain variable is asserted, the
           monster will check the number of lost souls on the level. If that 
           number is higher than 20, no attack will occur. If the flag is not
           set, there is no limitation. The monster will then spawn one lost
           soul immediately in front of it and face it toward its own target.
           If the comp_skull variable is off, the lost soul will be destroyed
           immediately if it is spawned over a blocking line. The lost soul's
           target will be set equal to the monster's, and then the SkullAttack
           codepointer will be called on it such that it performs a lost soul
           attack.<br>
  Notes:   The MBF friendliness flag's state is transferred to the spawned
           lost soul. Friendly Pain Elementals shoot friendly lost souls;
           enemy PE's fire enemies.
<br><br><br>
                      
<li> <b>BrainSpit</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, normal<br>
  Purpose: Boss brain spawn cube attack. If there are no boss spawn spots on
           the level, this function will do nothing. If the game is on the
           an easy skill level, this function will do nothing on every other
           call. Otherwise, a boss spawn spot will be selected by its map
           spawning order, and a BossSpawnCube object will be fired at it like
           a missile. The object will then emit the "bospit" sound effect.<br>
  Notes:   The MBF friendliness flag will be transferred to the spawn cube
           from the firing object. This is so that the cube will later
           spawn either an enemy or friendly monster, depending on the
           friendliness of its originating boss brain.

  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Object's damage field = damage multiplier
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is invalid or is of the same type as this
           object, no attack will occur. Otherwise, the object will play its 
           attack sound if it has one, and will face its target and damage it 
           directly for (rnd%8 + 1) multiplied by its missile damage field. 
           This is basically a long-range scratch. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer will
           not cause an error if the object does not have an attack sound.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>Scratch</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Amount of damage to inflict (default of 0 = 0)
  <li> Unknown 2 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound will be played)
  <li> Args1     = Special mode toggle (default of 0 = 0)

                 <li> 0 = Compatibility mode (Use value in "Unknown 1" as normal)
                 <li> 1 = Use object damage field
                 <li> 2 = Use counter specified in Args2
                 </ul>
  <li> Args2     = Counter field number for special mode 2 (default of 0 = 0)
                 <ul>
                 <li> 0 = Counter 0
                 <li> 1 = Counter 1
                 <li> 2 = Counter 2
                 </ul>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: If the object's target is valid and is within melee range
           (64 units), it will damage the target for the indicated amount.
           If the Unknown 2 parameter is non-zero and is a valid sound
           DeHacked number, the indicated sound will played along with the
           attack. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer will
           no longer crash the game if an invalid sound number is provided.
           No sound will be played if the number is invalid. 
           <br><br>
           Parameters Args1 and Args2 are new to Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta,
           and allow getting a damage value from other sources. If Args1 is
           1, the object's damage value will be used. If Args1 is 2, the
           value of the counter specified in Args2 will be used. When combined
           with SetCounter or CounterOp, this allows you to perform your own
           custom damage calculations. This change does not break 
           compatibility, as the Args1 default value is 0.
<br><br>    <br>       
        
<li> <b>MissileAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, Homing missile firing pointer, parameterized

  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to fire (no default, must be valid)
  <li> Args2 = Select homing property (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = will not home
            <li> 1 = may home
            </ul>
  <li> Args3 = Amount to add to standard z missile firing height (32 units)<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  <li> Args4 = Amount to add to actor angle in degrees<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  <li> Args5 = DeHackEd number of state to enter for optional melee attack<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no melee attack)
  </ul>
            <br>
  Purpose: Very powerful parameterized monster projectile attack pointer. Can
           be used to create standard attacks or angular spreads, with or
           without homing.  Can fire missiles at a customized height, and can
           optionally chain to another state when the object is within melee
           range of its target, allowing situational attacks like those used
           by the Imp, Baron, and Cacodemon.  The Args5 parameter should be 
           set to -1 unless a valid frame DeHackEd number is provided.
           New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 4.<br>
  Notes:   Missiles must have a homing maintenance pointer in their frames in
           order to home.
<br><br><br>
           
<li> <b>MissileSpread</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of thing type to fire (no default, must be valid)
  <li> Args2 = Number of missiles to fire (MUST be greater than or equal to 2)
  <li> Args3 = Amount to add to standard z missile firing height (32 units)<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, can be negative)
  <li> Args4 = Total angular sweep of attack in degrees<br>
            (default of 0 = 0)
  <li> Args5 = DeHackEd number of state to enter for optional melee attack<br>
            (default of 0 = 0, negative values = no melee attack)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Convenience codepointer for firing a barrage of missiles in an
           angular sweep. The object will face its target and begin firing
           missiles at its angle minus half the Args4 sweep value. It will
           then step Args4 / (Args2 - 1) degrees for each additional missile,
           spreading them out evenly, centered on the actor's angle. Thus, the 
           angular sweep is the total separation between the first and last 
           missiles in degrees. This codepointer can only be used to fire 2 or 
           more missiles. Providing a value of 0 or 1 will cause it to stop 
           without attacking. The Args5 parameter can be used to specify a 
           frame to use for an optional melee attack, used when the object is
           within melee range of its target. This parameter should be set to 
           -1 unless a valid frame DeHackEd number is provided.<br>
           New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 6.

<li> <b>BulletAttack</b><br>
  Type:    Monster attack, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = DeHackEd number of sound to play (default of 0 = no sound)
  <li> Args2 = Select accuracy (default of 0 = 1)
            <ul>
            <li> 1 = Always accurate
            <li> 2 = Never accurate<br>
                  (moderate horizontal spread with no vertical error)
            <li> 3 = Super Shotgun accuracy<br>
                  (wide horizontal spread with moderate vertical error)
            <li> 4 = Monster accuracy (very wide horizontal spread)
            </ul>
  <li> Args3 = Number of bullet tracers to fire (default of 0 = 0)
  <li> Args4 = Damage factor (Damage formula is: dmgfactor * ((rnd%dmgmod) + 1))
  <li> Args5 = Damage modulus<br>
            (Forced into range of 1 to 256)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Powerful codepointer which allows construction of custom monster
           bullet attacks. This pointer is capable of emulating any of the
           built-in player or monster bullet attacks, as well creating many
           completely new ones (including a super shotgun attack for
           monsters). New to Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 6.<br>
  Notes:   The Args2 parameter for this pointer differs slightly from the
           Args2 parameter to the FireCustomBullets player codepointer. The
           value which allows "first fire only" accuracy is not available 
           for monsters.

<ul>
<li> <b>Tracer</b><br>
  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Performs homing maintenance for Revenant missiles. If the missile
           was fired by a homing-missile-firing codepointer, it may home on its
           target. However, this pointer will cause the missile to fail to
           home depending upon the gametic at which it is called. If the 
           gametic is not divisible by 3, no actions will occur. Otherwise, one
           BulletPuff and one TracerSmoke object will be spawned behind the 
           missile, the TracerSmoke object will be given upward momentum, and 
           the missile will home on its target.<br>
  Notes:   As mentioned above, missiles do not always home when using this
           codepointer. Also, missiles must be fired by a homing-missile-
           firing codepointer or else no homing will take place.
           <br><br><br>

<li> <b>GenTracer</b><br>
  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Performs generic homing maintenance. If a missile was fired by a

           other special effects will occur. New to Eternity.

  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Threshold angle, integer
  <li> Args2 = Max turn angle, integer
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Performs Heretic-style homing missile maintenance. The threshold
           and max turn parameters affect when the missile will home and how
           far at maximum that it can turn, respectively. Different monsters
           use different values for these, and they can feasibly be set to
           any value from 0 to 359 degrees. Vertical adjustment of Heretic-
           style homing missiles is very conservative. Vertical momentum will
           only be adjusted if the missile is outside the height range of its
           target. As a result, the missile can hit the ground easily.<br>

  Type:    Homing missile maintenance pointer, normal<br>
  Purpose: Performs homing and movement logic maintenance for Iron Lich
           whirlwinds.<br> 
           The object's Counter 0 value is decremented by 3. If the resulting 
           value is less than zero, the object's momenta are set to zero, the 
           object is set to its deathstate, and the MISSILE flag is removed 
           from the object.<br> 
           The object's Counter 1 value is decremented by three. If the 
           resulting value is less than 0, the object's Counter 1 value is 
           set to 58 + (rnd % 32). The object will emit the ht_hedat3 sound 
           when this occurs.<br> 
           If the object's tracer target has died or has acquired the Bits3 
           GHOST flag, it will check its originator for a new target. If its 
           originator has a new target which is alive and, if the originator 
           is friendly, is not also a friend, this object will acquire the
           originator's target as its new tracer target. 
           If the tracer target is valid, it will be homed on via the effects
           of HticTracer using a threshold value of 10 degrees and a maxturn 
           value of 30 degrees.<br>

<b>Frame Scripting Pointers</b>
<hr width="40%" align="left"></a>

<p>
General Notes for Frame Scripting Codepointers:

<p>
These pointers allow a degree of programmatic control over an object's behavior,
and are therefore termed "frame scripting" codepointers. Note that some other
codepointers utilize the Counter fields of a thing, and so using those pointers 
along with these will cause interference. Codepointer descriptions now make
note of which Counter fields they utilize, so be sure to check for conflicts.

<p>
Counter fields may have values from -32768 to 32767. Values above or below this
range will wrap around.

<ul>
<li> <b>RandomJump</b><br>
  Type:    Frame scripting, parameterized
  <br><br>
  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Unknown 1 = Frame DeHackEd number to which object may jump <br>
                (default of 0 = frame 0)
  <li> Unknown 2 = Chance out of 256 that jump will occur (default of 0 = 0%)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame with the
           indicated probability. If the jump does not occur, the object
           will fall through to the next frame. If the current frame's
           tics are set to -1, fall-through will not occur. New to MBF.<br>
  Notes:   As of Eternity Engine v3.31 public beta 3, this codepointer
           will no longer crash the game if an invalid frame number is
           supplied. If the frame number is invalid, no jump will occur.

  Parameter Information:

  <li> Args1 = Frame DeHackEd number to which object may jump<br>
            (default of 0 = frame 0)
  <li> Args2 = Type of comparison to perform on object's health<br>
            (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = Jump if health &lt; Args3

            <li> 4 = Jump if health equals Args3
            <li> 5 = Jump if health does not equal Args3
            <li> 6 = Jump if health &amp; Args3 (bitwise AND operation)
            
            <li> 7 - 13 = The value in Args3 will be interpreted as a counter
              number (0 - 2). The resulting operation is the health compared
              against the value of the requested counter, subtracting 6
              from the operation number (ie. operation 7 is 
              "Jump if health &lt; counter").

  <li> Args3 = Value to compare health against / Counter number holding value<br>
            (default of 0 = 0)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame if the
           value in Args3 (or the given counter, for operations 7 through
           13) compares as requested to the object's current health. This 
           allows "frame scripting" of actions which vary depending on how 
           much damage an enemy or other object has received. If the jump does
           not occur, the object will fall through to the next frame. If the 
           current frame's tics are set to -1, fall-through will not occur.<br> 
           New to Eternity v3.31 public beta 7.<br>
  Notes:   Options 6 and 13, "bitwise and", are most useful for performing an
           action only if the object's health is even or odd. To perform an 
           action if the health value is odd, set Args3 to 1, and to perform an
           action if it is even, set Args3 to 2. Use of other values will 
           result in periodic chances for an action, and will require 
           experimentation.

  <li> Args1 = Frame DeHackEd number to which object may jump<br>

  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame if the object's
           target meets the following criteria:
           <ol>
           <li> The target must be valid.

                must not be a friend.
           </ol>
           If the jump does not occur, the object will fall through to the next 
           frame. If the current frame's tics are set to -1, fall-through will 
           not occur.<br>

            <li> 7 - 13 = The value in Args3 will be interpreted as a counter
              number (0 - 2). The resulting operation is the counter in Args3
              compared against the value of the counter in Args4, subtracting 
              7 from the operation number (ie. operation 7 is 
              "Jump if counter1 &lt; counter2").
            </ul>
  <li> Args3 = Value to compare against counter / Counter number holding value (default of 0 = 0)

  Purpose: Causes the object to transfer to the indicated frame if the

           requested to the provided value. This allows  "frame 
           scripting" of actions which vary depending on the current value
           of a thing's counters. If the jump does not occur, the object 
           will fall through to the next frame. If the current frame's 
           tics are set to -1, fall-through will not occur. <br>

  Parameter Information:
  <ul>
  <li> Args1 = Counter number to use (default of 0 = 0)
            <ul>
            <li> 0 = Counter 0

  <li> Args3 = Number of states in set<br>
            (No default, must be valid)
  </ul>
  <br>
  Purpose: This powerful codepointer implements an N-way branch where
           the value of the indicated counter determines to which frame
           the jump will occur. The frames to be jumped to must be
           defined in a consecutive block in EDF. The first frame in
           this set is deemed to be frame #0, and the last frame in
           the set is frame #Args3 - 1. The value of the counter is 
           considered to be zero-based, so that if it is equal to zero, 
           the object will jump to frame #0 (the frame you provided in 
           Args2). The entire range of frames must be valid, and if it 
           is not, no jump will occur. If the counter value is not in the 
           range from 0 to Args3 - 1, no jump will occur. Finally, if the
           counter number in Args1 is invalid, no jump will occur.<br>

           provided in Args2. New to Eternity Engine v3.31 Delta.<br>
  Notes:   For operation 4, division, Args2 may not be equal to zero, and

           and random modulus, Args2 must be greater than zero. No operation 
           will occur if it is less than or equal to zero. Operation 7 inverts 
           the bits in Args2 before bitwise-ANDing it with the value in the 
           counter. For operation 10, the value of Args2 is not used, and may 
           simply be allowed to default. All random numbers are between 0 and 
           255 inclusive. Operations 12 and 15-18 are not defined for this

  Notes:   For operation 4, division, Args2 may not be equal to zero, and

           operation will occur if it is less than or equal to zero.
           Operation 12, HITDICE, is the operation used to calculate standard
           damage values in DOOM, where Args1 acts as a multiplier and Args2
           acts as the modulus. All random numbers are between 0 and 255

           unary and do not use the Args2 parameter, but it must still be
           a valid counter number. You may allow it to default to zero.

General Notes for Small Scripting Codepointers:

<p>
These codepointers allow execution of Small functions in either of the Gamescript
