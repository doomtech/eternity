<b>What is DeHackEd?</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
DeHackEd with BOOM Extensions (BEX) is a form of text script for modifying various aspects
of the DOOM engine. Originally, DeHackEd patches were used by the DeHackEd program to
modify the DOOM.EXE file itself. Now, modern source ports provide alternative methods
of use.
<br><br>
Eternity allows use of DeHackEd files via the -deh command-line parameter, via GFS files, and
as a text lump called "DEHACKED" in wad files. Eternity can also specify up to two DeHackEd 
patches which are always added at start-up in its configuration file. Starting with Eternity
Engine v3.31 public beta 5, DeHackEd/BEX files can also be included by EDF modules.
<br><br>
DeHackEd allows editing of things, frames, codepointers, ammo and weapon data, cheats,
miscellaneous settings, and text strings. Through BEX and Eternity extensions, support
has also been added for a cleaner form of text substitution, default level par times,
a more powerful method of codepointer editing, helper thing type editing, and better
support for substitution of sprite, sound, and music names.
<br><br>
DeHackEd does NOT support the addition or deletion of any of these elements, however.
It is limited to the number and order of entries as they exist in the source port.
For information on how Eternity addresses this problem via the EDF system, see the
<a href="edf_ref.html">EDF Documentation</a>.

<b>General Syntax</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
White-space, empty lines, and unrecognized tokens are ignored outside of any block, and
the DeHackEd parser is in general very forgiving.
<br><br>
Comments can be provided for your own benefit, or for that of other editors. Comments
start with a pound sign (#) and extend to the end of the line.
Example:
<pre>
   # This is a comment
</pre>
Note that comments are not allowed within some blocks, including several of the
BEX extension blocks. It is best to keep all comments outside of blocks for this reason.
<br><br>
It is common for this header to appear in DeHackEd files which pre-date the DOOM source
release:
<pre>
   Patch File for DeHackEd v3.0

   # Note: Use the pound sign ('#') to start comment lines.

   Doom version = 21
   Patch format = 6
</pre>

However, none of this information is needed or used by Eternity in any way, and it is
discarded as unrecognized text. You do not need to include any header information in your
own files.  Note that the patch version information is important for old patches in that
it will tell you whether or not Eternity can use the file. Patches of format other than
6 are not guaranteed to work, and Eternity does NOT support the older, obsolete binary
patch format.

<p>
<a name="include">
<hr width="50%" align="left">
<b>BEX Extension: INCLUDE Directive</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>

To include a DEH or BEX file in another one, put one or more of the following lines in 
your BEX file:
<pre>
   INCLUDE filename
   INCLUDE NOTEXT filename
</pre>

Filename must be specified in full, including a path if it's not going to be in the 
current directory, and including its .deh or .bex extension.  It is better by far to 
ship a file completely self-contained, but you can use this during testing and 
development, or to adjust existing patches for your own use.
<br><br>
The NOTEXT directive will cause Eternity to skip any DeHackEd-style text blocks
in the included file, with the assumption that you're doing something else in your 
main BEX file instead.
<br><br>
You may not nest include files (one include file can't include another). In addition,
DEHACKED lumps in wads cannot use INCLUDE directives in any form.

The DeHackEd Thing block allows you to edit the properties of DOOM's map object
types. Map objects are what comprise anything you see with a sprite in DOOM,
including enemies, powerups, missiles, decorations, and invisible control objects.
<br><br>
Eternity provides several extensions to the DeHackEd thing block, some of which
are considered part of the BEX standard specification. Extended fields will be noted
as such in their descriptions.

Items in square brackets ([ ]) are optional.<br>
All fields in the block are optional. If a field is not provided, that value of the

Explanation of special information:
<br><br>
<b>dehacked number</b> is the DeHackEd number of the thing type that this block edits.
The DeHackEd number for a thing type is given in its EDF <b>thingtype</b> definition.
<br><br>
<b>(thing type name)</b> is an optional string which gives a descriptive name to this
block. This field is NOT used by Eternity, and can be left off. Its only purpose is to
serve as a comment letting you better know which thing type you are editing.

<b>Things: Fields</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
<ul>
<li> <b>ID # = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the id, or "doomednum", used to identify this thing type in maps.
     For example, when a map calls for a thing with id 2003, the game engine will find
     the thing type which has that number in this field. Every thing that will be spawned
     on maps must have a unique ID number. Things which are not spawned on maps, such
     as fireballs, can be given an ID of -1.<br><br>

<li> <b>Initial frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the frame which a thing starts in when it is spawned. Monsters
     generally use this frame to stand still and look for targets. &lt;frame number&gt;
     must be a valid frame DeHackEd number.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Hit points = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets a thing's maximum amount of life. It is only used for things which
     can be shot.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>First moving frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the frame which a monster will jump to when it sees or hears a
     target. Also called walking frames.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Alert sound = &lt;sound number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the sound that a monster will play when it awakens. This sound is also played
     by missiles when they are shot. &lt;sound number&gt; must be a valid sound number.
     See the <a href="#sndtable">sound number table</a> for details.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Reaction time = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets an amount of time that a thing must wait under certain circumstances. Monsters
     use this value as a means to control their rate of attack. This value is also used
     as an internal field for varying purposes, but those uses are not editable.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Attack sound = &lt;sound number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets a sound used by some monster attacks, including the Lost Soul's charge.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Injury frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the frame a thing may randomly enter when it has been injured.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Pain chance = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the chance out of 255 that this thing will enter its pain state when it is
     injured. A thing with 0 pain chance will never feel pain, whereas a thing with
     255 pain chance will always feel pain. If a thing has a pain chance greater than
     zero, it should have a valid Injury frame, otherwise it will disappear forever.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Pain sound = &lt;sound number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the sound played by the Pain codepointer when this thing uses it. Monsters
     and the player always call Pain from their Injury frames.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Close attack frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     If this frame is non-zero, monsters chasing a target will attempt to close to
     melee range quickly. When they determine they are within 64 units of their target,
     they may randomly enter this frame to perform a melee attack.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Far attack frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     If this frame is non-zero, monsters chasing a target will randomly enter it to
     perform a missile attack.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Death frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     When a thing dies normally, it will enter this state. If the state is zero, the thing 
     will disappear forever.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Exploding frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     If a thing dies by taking enough damage that its health is equal to its negated
     Hit points value, it will enter this frame instead of its Death frame. This is also
     known as gibbing, or extreme death. If this frame is zero, the thing will always
     die normally.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Death sound = &lt;sound number&gt;</b><br>
     Sound played by the Scream codepointer. Used to play monster death sounds.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Speed = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Value used by monsters as a movement delta per walking frame. The monster will move
     by an amount relative to this value each time it uses the Chase codepointer. For
     missiles, this value is a fixed-point number (multiplied by 65536), and represents
     a constant speed by which the missile advances every game tic. Missile speed is
     not affected by the missile frame durations, whereas monster walking speed is.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Width = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Fixed-point value (multiplied by 65536) that represents the radius of this thing
     type. A thing can fit into corridors which are at least as wide as this value
     times two, plus one unit (ie a thing with radius 32 can fit into a 65-wide hallway).
     The maximum value this field *should* have is 2097152, which is equal to 32 units.
     However, the game breaks its own rule here, giving several monsters radii up to
     128 units. These monsters, which include the mancubus, arachnotron, and spider demon,
     exhibit clipping errors which enable other things to walk into them, and which can
     cause some moving sectors to malfunction. Avoid giving things radii larger than this
     to remain absolutely safe.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Height = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Fixed-point value that represents the height of this thing type. A thing can fit
     into areas which are of this exact height or taller. Note that in DOOM, this value
     is only used to see where a monster can fit. For purposes of clipping, monsters are
     considered to be infinitely tall. However, Eternity's extended 3D object clipping
     enables this field to also be used to allow or disallow things to pass over, under, or
     stand on this thing.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Mass = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     Normal integer value that serves as a mass factor for this object. Mass affects the
     amount of thrust an object is given when it is damaged, the amount of effect an
     archvile's attack can have on it, and for bouncing objects, the rate at which they
     fall.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Missile damage = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     This number is used as a damage multiplier when a missile hits a thing. The damage
     formula used is:
     <pre>
        damage = ((rnd % 8) + 1) * missiledamage
     </pre>
     This field is also used as a parameter by some new, parameterized codepointers,
     including BetaSkullAttack and Detonate.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Action sound = &lt;sound number&gt;</b><br>
     Sets the sound used by a thing when it is wandering around. A thing is given a
     3 out of 256 chance (1.17%) of making this sound every time it calls the Chase
     codepointer. There are some new Bits3 flags which can alter the behavior of this
     sound.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Bits = &lt;number || flag list&gt;</b><br>
     This field controls a number of thing type properties using bit flags, where each
     bit in the field stands for some effect, and has the value of being either on or
     off. In old DeHackEd patches, this field is an integer number. BEX Extensions allow
     a human-readable string of flag values to be provided instead. See the flag field
     lists below for more information.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Bits2 = &lt;number || flag list&gt;</b><br>
     Similar to Bits but takes a different set of values with different meanings.
     This field is an Eternity extension.
     See below for more information.
     <br><br>
     
<li> <b>Bits3 = &lt;number || flag list&gt;</b><br>
     Similar to Bits but takes a different set of values with different meanings.
     This field is an Eternity extension.
     See below for more information.
     <br><br>

<li> <b>Respawn frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
     If this frame is non-zero, an Archvile can perform a resurrection on this creature.
     When this occurs, the creature will enter this frame.<br><br>

<li> <b>Translucency = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     This field is an Eternity extension which allows fine, customizable control over
     a thing's translucency. The value of this field may range from 0 to 65536, with
     0 being completely invisible, and 65536 being normal. Consider the following
     example:
     <pre>
        Thing 2 (Trooper)
        Translucency = 32768
     </pre>
     
     Trooper objects will be 50% translucent in this example, since 32768 is half of
     65536. Note this effect is mutually exclusive of BOOM-style translucency. If this
     value is not 65536, and the BOOM translucency flag is turned on, the flag will be
     turned off at run-time, and this field will take precedence.<br><br>
     
<li> <b>Blood color = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
     This field is an Eternity extension. Allows this thing type to have differently colored

This is actually something you can use to hack your DeHackEd file to be more understandable 
and modifiable.  Note that once you do this you won't be able to bring it back into DeHackEd.
<br><br>
If you've altered a thing's bits at all, you'll see a line like:
<pre>
  Bits = 205636102
</pre>

That horrible number is why we are providing some mnemonics instead.  All you need to do 
is to put the appropriate ones of the following mnemonics on the line where the big number 
is, and it'll be read in and converted to the number for you.  Some valid example lines:
<pre>
  Bits = SOLID+SHOOTABLE+NOBLOOD
  ...
  Bits = NOBLOCKMAP | NOGRAVITY
  ...
  Bits = SPECIAL, COUNTITEM
</pre>

which converts to Bits = 524294 but you didn't have to figure that part out.  Just use a plus,
'|', comma, or whitespace between the mnemonics. Below are mnemonic lists, along with a bit of 
explanation of each,  and the phrase that's used in Dehacked to describe them.  If there are any 
disagreements between the 2 definitions, ours wins.

Notes on Bits values:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> NOSECTOR:<br>
     This flag has some odd side effects. For a pure total invisibility effect, use the new
     DONTDRAW flag in the Bits2 field.
<li> JUSTHIT:<br>
     This flag is for internal AI use, applying it to a thing will have more or less no effect.
<li> JUSTATTACKED:<br>
     As above.
<li> PICKUP:<br>
     Only the player should possess this flag. If monsters try to pick up items, results will
     be undefined. This may change in the future.
<li> SLIDE:<br>
     This flag has absolutely no effect and is never used anywhere. For compatibility, it must
     remain this way. A new flag, SLIDE, in the Bits3 field, DOES have this effect, however, and
     is used by the player object and Heretic pods, by default.
<li> INFLOAT:<br>
     This flag is for internal AI use only.
<li> COUNTKILL:<br>
     This flag actually has two effects. If a monster does not have the COUNTKILL flag, other
     monsters may ignore it, and some other engine features will not work properly for it. This 
     is generally undesirable. A new Bits3 flag KILLABLE, used by the Lost Soul by default, 
     allows monsters to behave normally even without having this flag.
<li> SKULLFLY:<br>
     This flag is for internal AI use only.
<li> TOUCHY:<br>
     This new MBF extension allows things to instantly die if any solid thing of a differing
     species touches it. Note that for purposes of this effect, Lost Souls and Pain Elementals
     are considered to be the same species.
<li> BOUNCES:<br>
     This flag declares that the thing is bouncy. The exact behavior of the thing can be
     modified by combining this with other flags in the following manners:
     <ul>
     <li> BOUNCES + MISSILE:<br>
          Object bounces off of floors and ceilings only.
     <li> BOUNCES + NOGRAVITY:<br> 
          Object bounces off all surfaces without losing momentum, unless its also a missile.
     <li> BOUNCES + FLOAT:<br>
          Without NOGRAVITY, allows monsters to jump to reach their target.
     <li> BOUNCES + FLOAT + DROPOFF:<br>
          Allows even higher bouncing / jumping.
     <li> BOUNCES:<br>
          When the flag is alone, without MISSILE, it allows the object to bounce off
          all surfaces, losing momentum at each contact. It can also roll up and down
          steps. This is highly realistic.
     </ul>
<li> TRANSLUCENT:<br>
     This thing will use the global BOOM translucency level for its sprite. If general
     translucency is off, it will draw normally. This effect is mutually exclusive with the
     new Eternity extension for translucency. If the latter is enabled, this flag will be
     turned off by the game at run-time.

Notes on Bits2 values:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> LOGRAV:<br>
     Has no effect on BOUNCY things
<li> REMOVEDEAD:<br>
     Things with this flag also cannot respawn in Nightmare mode. Do not give the player
     this flag.
<li> DORMANT:<br> 
     Does not function as expected unless a thing is spawned on the map at startup with 
     the <a href="editref.html#part4">DORMANT mapthing flag</a> set in the level itself. 
     It cannot be switched on and off freely.
<li> SEEKERMISSILE:<br>
     This flag is used by reflection code to check if a missile is being used as a homing
     missile. When a homing missile with this flag is reflected, its tracer target will
     be set to the thing that fired it, so that it will properly home on its originator
     instead of its original target.     
<li> REFLECTIVE:<br> 
     Does not impart invulnerability, and unless paired with that flag, the object will 
     take damage before bouncing the projectile back.

Notes on Bits3 values:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li> SLIDE:<br>
     As noted in the documentation for Bits flag SLIDE, it does nothing. This
     flag, however, actually works, and is used by the player and by Heretic pods.
<li> WINDTHRUST:<br>
     This controls only which things are affected by the new Heretic wind special, controlled
     by <a href="editref.html#hticpush">control linedef type 293</a>. Any thing type with this 
     flag will experience thrust relative to the angle and magnitude of the control linedef 
     when it is anywhere within a tagged sector.
<li> KILLABLE:<br>
     As noted in the documentation for Bits flag COUNTKILL, enemies without that flag
     normally suffer severe side-effects. This new flag generalizes what was previously
     a special case for the Lost Soul, and allows enemies which don't count toward the
     kill percentage to be otherwise normal.

<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Sprite number = &lt;sprite number&gt;</b><br>
    Sets the sprite to be displayed by an object or gun using this frame. Must be a valid
    sprite number between 0 and the max number of sprites currently defined minus 1.  The
    number of sprites is dependent upon the number of sprites defined via EDF.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Sprite subnumber = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
    Sets the frame of the sprite to be displayed when this frame is entered. Sprite
    subnumbers correspond directly to the letters used to identify sprite frame graphics
    in the wad, starting with 0 = A, 1 = B, etc.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Duration = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
    Sets the duration of time a thing or gun will remain in this frame. Duration is of
    unit "tics," and there are 35 tics per second. This means that a frame lasting 35 tics
    will last exactly 1 second. A Duration value of 0 allows a thing to pass through multiple
    frames in a single gametic. A Duration value of -1 means that the thing will remain in
    this frame forever.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Next frame = &lt;frame number&gt;</b><br>
    Indicates what frame the thing or gun will proceed to after completing this one. Must
    be a valid frame DeHackEd number. Note that frame 0 is treated specially, and objects
    that transfer to it may be removed by the game engine.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Unknown 1 = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
    This field, for player gun frames, can alter the position of the gun graphic on screen.
    Use of the field for this purpose is deprecated, however, and is not recommended. This
    field also serves as a parameter to some MBF parameterized codepointers.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Unknown 2 = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
    As above.
    <br><br>
<li><b>Particle event = &lt;number&gt;</b><br>
    This Eternity extension allows a frame to specify a particle event that it can trigger.
    Particle events are triggered immediately after the frame's codepointer function is
    executed.<br><br>
    Particle Events Currently Available:
    <pre>
    Number  Effect    
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    0       None
    1       Rocket explosion particle burst
    2       BFG explosion particle burst
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    </pre>
<li><b>Args1 - Args5</b><br>
    These fields are an Eternity extension which allows extended parameters to be used by
    the codepointer in this frame. Parameterized codepointers are extremely powerful, allowing
    frame-specific customization of attacks, AI actions, sound, etc. See the 
    <a href="codeptrs.html">Eternity Engine Definitive Codepointer Reference</a>

<br>
Eternity provides limited support for old DeHackEd-style text substitution. This method
of text substitution is severely limited, syntactically ugly, and not completely backward
compatible. This section has been deprecated by the <a href="#strings">BEX [STRINGS] block</a>, 
and by the Eternity <a href="#music">[MUSIC]</a>, <a href="#sounds">[SOUNDS]</a>, and 
<a href="#sprites">[SPRITES]</a> blocks. Do not use this block in new files!

<br><br>
Eternity performs old DeHackEd-style text substitution by searching through the game's
BEX string table for a string with a matching value. If no such string can be found, the
substitution is discarded. Many strings which existed in DOOM are no longer available in
Eternity.

<br><br>
Note: Beginning with EE 3.33.50, it is possible for strings to be replaced multiple times,
and for strings to still be replaceable even if another different string is given the same
value. The original value of strings is now always used to compare against the old strings,
instead of the newest value taken from the DEH/BEX patch. This significantly improves 
compatibility with old patches that swap sprite, sound, and music names.

<br><br>
<b>old string</b> is the old string to be replaced, exactly as it appears in the
executable. Case is considered irrelevant when looking for a match.
<br><br>
<b>new string</b> is the new string. Case and formatting characters will be preserved.

The DeHackEd sprite string redirection method is not supported by the BEX specification or
by Eternity. The syntax of this block was as follows:
<pre>
   <font color="#FF0000">
   Sprite &lt;sprite number&gt;
   Offset = &lt;pointer&gt;
   </font>
</pre>
This allowed the sprite name order to be rearranged, but could also allow the game to be
crashed or corrupted very easily. For this reason and others, this feature is unsupported.
Any sprite blocks will be ignored.

<b>[STRINGS]: Description</b>

<br>
The basic Dehacked file is understood and properly evaluated to change such things as sounds, 
frame rewiring, Thing attributes, etc.  No change is required to the original .deh file for 
those things.  However, text is handled differently in BEX for several reasons:
<br><br>
<ol>
<li> Dehacked by the nature of the program was simply doing a search and replace action on 
     the strings as found in the executable.  This is clumsy and dangerous, though as good 
     as can be done when dealing with a compiled executable program.  We now have the ability 
     to change the actual string values during play, a safer and better solution.
     <br><br>
<li> Because Dehacked used the original string to find the place to plug in the replacement, 
     there was no way to write a generic hack that would replace strings in all versions 
     regardless of language.  In BEX, the strings are identified by their names, which are the 
     same in all cases.
     <br><br>
<li> Because Dehacked was replacing strings in a physical location in the program file, it was 
     limited to approximately the same size string as the original.  Though this is generally 
     practical, it is limiting in flexibility.  BEX allows any length string to replace any of 
     the ones in the game (this also applies to cheats).
     <br><br>
<li> The purpose of replacing a string is to show the player some text at a particular point in 
     the game.  Finding the original text that was there and replacing it with other text worked, 
     but logically what the author should have been able to do was assign strings depending on 
     the desired purpose, and not have to recognize the original text to do so. In BEX, all 
     strings are identified by a mnemonic name (actually the name of the internal variable), 
     making it easier to assign a string to its desired purpose.
</ol>

Detailed information is available further down in this file, explaining the mnemonic codes that 
are used for all the replaceable strings. Note that some of the strings are always displayed in 
the small (uppercase only) font, so capitalization is not important for those.

<br>
To use BEX string support, start the section with a [STRINGS] section marker, 
followed by lines that start with the key mnemonic, an equal sign, and the value to assign 
to that string.  You may split the value to be assigned onto multiple lines by ending each 
line that is to be continued with a backslash.  Don't put quotes around the string if you 
don't want them to show up in the result.  A couple of examples:
<pre>
   # Change the level name that shows up in the automap for MAP12:
   [STRINGS]
   HUSTR_12 = The Twelfth Night
   # and now the new red key message for switches
   PD_REDO = You need the scarlet pimpernel to \
             turn on this machine.   
   # Note that the blank before the backslash is included in the string
   # but that the indentation before the word "turn" is not, allowing
   # the change file to be easy to read.

<b>[CODEPTR]: Description</b>
<hr width="50%" align="left">
</a>
<br>
The [CODEPTR] block provides a new, clean, and more powerful method of changing the
codepointer (aka action) field of frames.
<br><br>
The [CODEPTR] block is a list of frames, each of which has assigned to it a codepointer
mnemonic. Codepointer mnemonics are symbolic names for the action functions they represent,
and any mnemonic can be assigned to any frame, even frames that have a zero pointer. This was
not allowed in DeHackEd.
<br><br>
BEX also provides a new NULL mnemonic, which allows zeroing of frames which have a 
codepointer in them already. This also was not allowed under DeHackEd, for reasons unknown.

</a>
<br>
Insert this block into your BEX file:
<pre>
   [CODEPTR]
   Frame nn = &lt;mnemonic&gt;
   ...
</pre>

Any number of frames may be listed, one per line.
<br><br>
The Frame number is the same as you would use in Dehacked, and the &lt;mnemonic&gt; is 
a symbolic codepointer name.  These mnemonics, though not perfectly clear in some cases, are the 
actual names of the functions in DOOM that are called, so it makes the most sense to use 
them. A complete list of codepointer mnemonics, and full documentation of their corresponding
codepointers' behaviors is now available in the 
<a href="codeptrs.html">Eternity Engine Definitive Codepointer Reference</a>.
Please refer to that file for full information.
<br><br>
When using Dehacked frame code pointer changes, Eternity will write out a line for each 
one used showing what you'd put into a BEX [CODEPTR] block, in the DEHOUT.TXT file.  
For example:
<br><br>
Original Dehacked file lines:
<pre>
   Pointer 93 (Frame 196)
   Codep Frame = 176
</pre>

Output from Eternity in the DEHOUT.TXT file, when -dehout parameter is used:
<pre>
   Line='Pointer 93 (Frame 196)'
   Processing function [2] for Pointer
   Processing Pointer at index 196: Frame
    - applied 1c53c from codeptr[176] to states[196]
   BEX [CODEPTR] -> FRAME 196 = Chase
</pre>

You could then use this in the [CODEPTR] block of a BEX file 
instead of the Dehacked lines, making it much more clear 
that in frame 196 you expect the monster to Chase the player:
<pre>
   FRAME 196 = Chase
</pre>

In addition, you can now put any code pointer into any frame, whereas
Dehacked is limited to replacing only the existing ones.

player. It may be desirable to edit the height and radii of most things to make them work
better as helpers

Note that the dog jumping options also affect any helper substitute, and that all friendly 
things of the helper type are allowed to jump down to follow the player.

If the original initial value is longer than about 40 characters, 
the string will have been truncated and will have an ellipsis (...)

If a string has C language printf() characters in it, such as %s or %d, 
you should be sure that your replacement string either contains the
