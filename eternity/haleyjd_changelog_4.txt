I discovered that a subtle problem still existed with my new approach to
button_t sound-playing for switches which could result in the switch sounds 
jumping to global position (0,0) - this was due to the fact that button_t's
would be immediately cleared, even while the sound they just started was still
playing.

To fix this, I went ahead and implemented my previous idea of linedef sound
origins, which consist of a degenmobj_t which is positioned at the center point
of every linedef at startup (and yes, polyobjects drag this around too, keeping 
it consistent with the linedef's location).

This may open the door in the future for some new linedef-based features, an
area of DOOM-editing which I do not think has been exploited to even a fraction
of its potential by any port so far.

Esselfortium found that Eternity could crash when less than 17 members were a 
part of the cast call sequence. A small logical error lead to some very
selective trashing of memory near the castinfo array. This was due to use of 
OLDCASTMAX without checking if numcastinfo was less than that value when
populating cast members with the default names defined via BEX strings.

Also, the screen clear routine in the IWAD picker module was always resolving
RGB (0,0,0) to a surface-format color value on every call because I forgot the
keyword "static" before the firsttime variable's declaration. I fixed that up.

While trying to play an interesting PrBoom 2.02 demo posted on Doomworld where
a Pain Elemental is fooled into killing a Boss Brain whilst trying to attack a
Revenant while the player is dead, ending the level, I discovered that a simple
logic error in MBF's comp vector handling prevented such demos from synching
artificially. Basically, if the demo was recorded with "compatibility," the old
BOOM setting, disabled, then MBF's logic would set the entire comp vector to 
"false," including any comp vars that didn't exist as of 2.02. This was just
plain wrong.

The proper action is to set all the comp vector values that were included as
part of "compatibility" originally to the state of that variable, and to set any
newer ones to true unconditionally. Eternity should have excellent PrBoom 2.02
demo compatibility so long as the demos in question are not for maps that use
certain BOOM features - friction, mainly.
