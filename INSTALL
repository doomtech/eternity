Basic Installation
==================

  Installation on POSIX platforms is done using CMake, better described in
  README-CMAKE.txt.  The autotools system (autogen.sh, configure.sh, etc.) will
  not successfully build Eternity.

  The installation process installs Eternity to /usr/local/games and the
  Eternity base dir to ~/.eternity/base . This is where the Eternity EDFs and
  WADs are stored, as well as screenshots (in base/shots), client/server demos
  (in base/demos) and configs (in base/doom and base/heretic). Note that
  lindirs.sh is the thing setting up the WAD and screenshot dirs, as well as
  copying over the WADs and EDFs, not make install.

  lindirs.sh also checks that an environment variable called ETERNITYBASE
  exists (this points to the ee base dir) and if not, adds

    export ETERNITYBASE='~/.eternity/base'

  to your .bashrc .

  You may also wish to define DOOMWADDIR and DOOMWADPATH in your profile as
  well.

Requirements
============

  The following libraries are required in order to build Eternity.

  - SDL 1.2.14
  - `SDL_net` 1.2.7
  - `SDL_mixer` 1.2.8
  - BZip2 1.0.4
  - zlib 1.2.3
  - libarchive 2.8.0
  - c-ares 1.7.3
  - cURL 7.21.0
  - JSON-C 0.9
  - ENet 1.3.0

  In general, any later version of each library will suffice.  Notable
  incompatibilities include:

  - SDL (net or mixer) 1.3
  - ENet 1.4 or higher (does not exist at the time of this writing).

  Additionally, ENet also ships a 1.2 version that is incompatible with ENet
  1.3, and Eternity will not build with it.
