I removed all the dead code for pickupfx that resulted from the previous
revision and merged in changes from trunk.

I have kicked off inventory-branch with the previously planned redaction of the
pickup effects array feature in EDF used to bind item effects to sprite names.
It was determined that no extant working modifications for Eternity made use of
this misfeature, and so removing it will not represent a compatibility issue.
For now it is still syntactically accepted, and could in fact be restored in
the future if I find it easy enough, but right now I'm not making special plans
to accomodate it.

This has disabled all SPECIAL item behaviors on this branch for the time being.
You are still able to collect items, but they do nothing - no effects, no
messages, no palette flash, and no sound. All of these are basic inventory item
properties that need to be retrieved from EDF.
