/*
 * [CG] The way these have to work is:
 *      - Surface for game type
 *      - Surface for time/frag/score limit
 *      - Surface for timer
 *      - For team games:
 *        - Surfaces for team names
 *        - Surfaces for team scores
 *      - Surfaces for each connected client
 *
 *      This probably means the days of player->frags[targetnum]++ are over,
 *      replaced by P_IncrementFrags(int fraggernum, int frageenum), etc. so
 *      they can also mark that client's surface as needing refreshed.
 *
 *      Additionally, it probably makes sense to build the capability to
 *      arrange client surfaces in various ways.
 *      - Team games:
 *        - Which team comes first
 *        - Split teams horizontally or vertically
 *      - Client stat columns
 *        - Name is not optional
 *          - Minimum width; I'm guessing enough for "[SUC]Potentpotables...",
 *            past which a name will be ellipsized if there isn't enough
 *            horizontal space.
 *        - Which columns to display
 *        - Allow/force/forbid linebreaks in column display
 *          - If linebreaks are forbidden, column names are printed as a "first
 *            row"; otherwise they're printed as labels, i.e. "ping: 38ms".
 *        - Every column has width & height; so running out of space can be
 *          caught and denied.
