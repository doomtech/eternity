<b>Basic Syntax</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
The basic syntax of MapInfo is very simple. Here are the rules:<br><br>

<ul>
<li> All whitespace not between two non-whitespace characters is ignored.
<li> Any unknown variable name is ignored.
<li> All values are treated as text strings, and quotation marks are not required.
<li> Comments may start with '#', ';', or '//'. All three comments are single line only,
     and extend to the end of the line.
<li> An optional equal sign can be placed between a variable and the value it is given. It is
     not an error to omit it.
<li> Block headers are required, and are enclosed in square brackets ([ ]). Block headers
     differ between global and level header MapInfo. See the respective sections in this
     documentation for what block headers you can use in a particular MapInfo lump.
</ul>

<b>MapInfo Variables</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
This section explains each variable which is available in MapInfo. All variables are available
in both global and level header MapInfo, and accept the same values in both types.
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b>altskyname</b><br>
    Name of a texture to display instead of the normal sky texture during a lightning strike.
    This value is only used if lightning is enabled for this level. If this value is not provided,
    no sky animation will occur during lightning strikes.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>altskyname = LBOLTSKY</pre>
    
<li><b>boss-specials</b><br>
    A flags field that specifies what formerly level-specific boss "magic codepointer" actions
    are enabled for this level. This field takes a value in the same format as that used by
    EDF, DeHackEd/BEX, and ExtraData flag fields, but the format will be reviewed here for
    completeness.
        <br><br>
    A BEX flag list is a string of flag names separated by whitespace, pipe characters, commas, 
    or plus characters. Flags are combined using bitwise-OR logic, so a flag name can be 
    specified more than once. Specifying a flag name causes that flag to be turned on. The 
    default state of all flags is off.
    <br><br>
    These are the flag values which are available for this field:
    <pre>
    Flag name  Decimal  Hex     Meaning
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    MAP07_1    1        0x0001  MAP07 Special 1 (BossDeath only)
    MAP07_2    2        0x0002  MAP07 Special 2 (BossDeath only)
    E1M8       4        0x0004  E1M8 Special
    E2M8       8        0x0008  E2M8 Special
    E3M8       16       0x0010  E3M8 Special
    E4M6       32       0x0020  E4M6 Special (BossDeath only)
    E4M8       64       0x0040  E4M8 Special
    E5M8       128      0x0080  E5M8 Special (HticBossDeath Only)
    -----------------------------------------------------------------</pre>
    Notes: Actions differ depending on whether monsters use the BossDeath or HticBossDeath
    codepointers. See the documentation for those specific codepointers to see what actions
    they perform. The monsters which must be dead for a given special to activate are controlled
    by various EDF/BEX thingtype flags. Together, these features allow complete customization.
    <br><br>
    Example flags fields -- All of these are equivalent:
    <pre>
    boss-specials = MAP07_1|MAP07_2
    boss-specials = MAP07_1 | MAP07_2
    
    boss-specials = MAP07_1+MAP07_2
    boss-specials = MAP07_2 + MAP07_2
    
    boss-specials = MAP07_1,MAP07_2
    boss-specials = MAP07_1, MAP07_2

    boss-specials = MAP07_1 MAP07_2</pre>

<li><b>colormap</b><br>
    Name of a colormap lump to use as the global colormap for this level. This colormap is 
    applied to any sectors which do not have their own colormaps specified either via use of
    242 height transfer linedefs or scripting. This lump must be between C_START and C_END
    tags.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>colormap = FOGMAP</pre>
    
<li><b>creator</b><br>
    The level author's name, which can be viewed in the console using the "creator" console
    command. If this value is not provided, the default value is "unknown".<br>
    Example:
    <pre>creator = Edwin Chadwick 'chadders'</pre>
    
<li><b>doublesky</b><br>
    Boolean value that determines whether or not this map uses double skies. When double skies
    are enabled, any F_SKY1 or F_SKY2 sectors *not* affected by MBF sky transfer lines will
    use both the primary and secondary sky textures together. The secondary texture will be
    drawn first, normally, then the primary texture will be drawn over it, omitting any pixels
    which use palette index zero (this is usually pure black). Any MapInfo sky delta values
    provided will be applied to their respective textures.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>doublesky = true</pre>
    
<li><b>edf-intername</b><br>
    Boolean value which, if true, enables the use of EDF-defined intermission map name
    strings which will be drawn using the FONTB graphics (provided in eternity.wad for
    DOOM/DOOM II, and natively supported by Heretic). This feature is meant to obsolete 
    the levelpic variable and to remove the need for authors to create title graphics for 
    their maps in DOOM/DOOM II. It also allows intermission map name replacement to work 
    correctly for the next level and for Heretic without any hacks.<br>
    The EDF string which will be used as the intermission name for the current map should
    have the mnemonic _IN_NAME_&lt;mapname&gt;, where &lt;mapname&gt; is the exact name of
    the map's header lump (Example: _IN_NAME_MAP01).<br>
    In order for the name of the next map to display correctly, the current level must
    either define its nextlevel/nextsecret values explicitly, or it must be an ExMy or 
    MAPxy level.
    <br>
    Example:
    <pre>edf-intername = true</pre>
    
<li><b>endofgame</b><br>
    Boolean value which, if true, causes a DOOM II cast call to occur when this map is
    exited. This value is currently only usable in DOOM II. A level must also have 
    intermission text defined for a cast call to take place.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>endofgame = true</pre>
    
<li><b>extradata</b><br>
    Name of the ExtraData script lump for this map. See the  
    <a href="extradata.html">ExtraData Reference</a> for full information on ExtraData. 
    There are no naming restrictions on ExtraData script lumps.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>extradata = EXTRDT01</pre>
    
<li><b>finale-secret</b><br>
    Boolean value which, if true, indicates that a text intermission should only occur after
    this map if a secret exit was taken. If no intermission text is defined for this map, this
    variable has no effect.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>finale-secret = true</pre>
    
<li><b>fullbright</b><br>
    Boolean value that determines whether fullbright can be used on this level. When 
    fullbright is disabled, player gun flashes will not occur, and fullbright sprites and
    particles will be drawn normally. This should be used with most custom colormaps, since
    flashes and fullbright sprites usually look incorrect with them.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>fullbright = false</pre>
    
<li><b>gravity</b><br>
    Global gravity factor for the current level. The default gravity value is 65536.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>
    # Enable 50% gravity
    gravity = 32768</pre>

<li><b>inter-backdrop</b><br>
    Name of a 64x64 flat OR a 320x200 graphic lump to be displayed as the background of a
    text intermission which occurs after this map. The flat namespace will be searched first,
    so if both a flat and a 320x200 picture of the same name exist, the flat will be chosen.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>inter-backdrop = FLATHUH1</pre>
    
<li><b>intermusic</b><br>
    Name of a MUS or MIDI lump to use as music during a text intermission which occurs after
    this map. If no intertext is defined for the map, this value will not be used.
    In DOOM gamemodes, the string provided should be the lump name minus the "D_" prefix. In 
    Heretic, the string provided should be the lump name minus the "MUS_" prefix. You are 
    *not* limited to using only the built-in music lump names; Eternity automatically adds 
    any new lump which matches the naming convention for the current gamemode to the internal 
    music list.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>intermusic = ROMERO</pre>

<li><b>interpic</b><br>
    Name of a 320x200 graphic lump to be displayed as the background of the statistics
    intermission. This value is currently only used for DOOM II and Ultimate DOOM episode 4
    maps.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>interpic = BOSSBACK</pre>
    
<li><b>intertext</b><br>
    Lump name of a text lump to be loaded as intermission text for this level. If the level
    has an intermission by default, this will replace the default intermission text, even if
    it has been edited via DeHackEd. If there is not normally a text intermission after this
    map, the presence of this variable serves to enable it. If no intertext is defined, a
    text intermission will not occur after a map. The formatting of the text inside the 
    indicated lump will be preserved exactly, with the exception of tabs, which are converted
    to spaces. There is no length limitation, but only one screen of text can be displayed. Any
    extra text will be drawn off the bottom of the screen.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>intertext = MAP04TXT</pre>
    
<li><b>killfinale</b><br>
    Boolean value that allows built-in text intermission points to be disabled. For example,
    if you do not want text to appear after DOOM II MAP11, set this variable to true.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>killfinale = true</pre>
    
<li><b>killstats</b><br>
    Boolean value that allows the statistics intermission between two maps to be disabled.
    If the map has a finale sequence to be displayed, it will start immediately, otherwise
    the next map will be loaded.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>killstats = true</pre>    
    
<li><b>levelname</b><br>
    This is the name of the level which will be displayed in the automap. This value overrides
    any string provided via DeHackEd.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>levelname = chadders' lair</pre>
    
<li><b>levelpic</b><br>
    This is the name of a graphic lump which will be shown as the level name during the 
    statistics intermission when this map is the previous map which was just beaten. 
    Note: you cannot currently specify the graphic to be shown for the next map. This is 
    a known bug in MapInfo and may not be repaired due to the new edf-intername feature. 
    This value is only used for DOOM and DOOM II maps.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>levelpic = E1M1PIC</pre>
    
<li><b>levelscript</b><br>
    Name of a compiled Small script lump which will serve as the Levelscript for this map.
    See the <a href="small_usagedoc.html">Small Usage Documentation</a> for full information
    on how the Levelscript works. There are no naming restrictions on script lumps.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>levelscript = SCRIPT01</pre>
    
<li><b>lightning</b><br>
    Boolean value that toggles the global lightning effect. When set to true, all sky sectors
    on the map will flash at randomly determined intervals along with a thunder sound and
    optional animation of the normal sky texture. Warning: sectors must currently have a sky
    ceiling at the beginning of the level in order to be affected by lightning. The only current
    method to make non-sky sectors flash during lightning strikes is via use of BOOM lighting
    transfer linedefs. This may be improved in the near future.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>lightning = true</pre>
    
<li><b>music</b><br>
    Provides the name of a MUS or MIDI lump to use as music. In DOOM gamemodes, the string
    provided should be the lump name minus the "D_" prefix. In Heretic, the string provided
    should be the lump name minus the "MUS_" prefix. You are *not* limited to using only the
    built-in music lump names; Eternity automatically adds any new lump which matches the
    naming convention for the current gamemode to the internal music list.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>music = cheese</pre>
    
<li><b>nextlevel</b><br>
    The exact header name of the next level to go to when a normal exit occurs on this map.
    This can specify *any* lump name, but the lump should be a valid level header or an error
    will occur.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>nextlevel = CHAD2</pre>
    
<li><b>nextsecret</b><br>
    The exact header name of the next level to go to when a secret exit occurs on this map.
    This can specify *any* lump name, but the lump should be a valid level header or an error
    will occur. Note that except for maps which normally have secret exits, the default behavior
    is to repeat the same level. This MapInfo value allows you to avoid that and use a secret
    exit on any map.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>nextsecret = MAP34</pre>
    
<li><b>partime</b><br>
    Partime for the map in seconds. This value overrides any value provided via DeHackEd.
    Note that partimes are only supported in episodes 1-3 of DOOM and any map of DOOM II.
    Ultimate DOOM episode 4, Heretic, and non-standard maps currently never display par times.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>partime = 200</pre>
    
<li><b>skydelta</b><br>
    Pixels per gametic that the primary sky texture should scroll. This effect will only be
    applied to double skies and to F_SKY1 sectors which are NOT affected by any MBF sky
    transfer linedefs.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>skydelta = 5</pre>
    
<li><b>sky2delta</b><br>
    Pixels per gametic that the secondary sky texture should scroll. This effect will only be
    applied to double skies and to F_SKY2 sectors (which cannot be affected by MBF sky
    transfer linedefs).<br>
    Example:
    <pre>sky2delta = 7</pre>    
    
<li><b>skyname</b><br>
    Name of a texture to use as the primary sky for this map. This sky will appear in all
    sectors which use the F_SKY1 flat, and it will also appear as the top layer of Hexen-style
    double skies. The name provided for this lump must be a valid texture or an error will 
    occur.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>skyname = SKY2</pre>
    
<li><b>sky2name</b><br>
    Name of a texture to use as the secondary sky for this map. This sky will appear in all
    sectors which use the F_SKY2 flat, and it will also appear as the bottom layer of Hexen-
    style double skies. The name provided for this lump must be a valid texture or an error
    will occur. If no name is provided for the secondary sky, the primary sky name will be
    copied to it, so it is not an error to use F_SKY2 or double skies in a level where the
    sky2 texture is not explicitly defined.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>sky2name = SKY4</pre>
    
<li><b>unevenlight</b><br>
    Boolean value that determines whether walls parallel to the x and y axes of the game
    world are given lighting values 1 level higher or lower than other walls. This can 
    dramatically affect the perceived light level of an area, so only use it for maps that
    are designed specifically for it. Maps which use custom global colormaps should usually
    set this value to false, since it only generally looks appropriate with the normal
    colormap.<br>
    Example:
    <pre>unevenlight = false</pre>

<li><b>sound-swtchn</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "swtchn" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-swtchx</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "swtchx" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-stnmov</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "stnmov" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-pstop</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "pstop" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-pstart</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "pstart" sound for this map.
    <br><br>    
<li><b>sound-bdcls</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "bdcls" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-bdopn</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "bdopn" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-dorcls</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "dorcls" sound for this map.
    <br><br>
<li><b>sound-doropn</b><br>
    EDF mnemonic of a sound to replace the default "doropn" sound for this map.

<b>The Global MapInfo System</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
Starting with Eternity Engine v3.31 'Delta', Eternity supports global MapInfo. Global MapInfo
has mostly the same format as level header MapInfo, except the information for multiple maps
can be placed into a single lump named EMAPINFO. Any number of EMAPINFO lumps can exist and 
will cascade as documented below.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="gsyn">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Specific Syntax Information</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
In the global MapInfo lump, variables for each level must be placed under a section header
that has the same name as the map's header lump.<br>
Example:
<pre>     [START]
     levelname = Eternity Start Map
     music = romero
     creator = Derek 'Afterglow' Mac Donald
     skyname = SKY3
     levelscript = STARTSCR</pre>

This would assign all the values beneath the [START] section header and above any subsequent
header to the map named START (in this case, the Eternity startmap). 

<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li> Entries can exist for maps that do not exist; such entries will never be used. 
<li> Any number of maps can have entries in the EMAPINFO lump. 
<li> Only the first section defined for a map in an EMAPINFO lump will be used. If another
     section for the same map exists in the same lump, it will be ignored.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="cascade">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Global Lump Cascading</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
As mentioned in the introduction to this section, global MapInfo lumps can cascade. This means
that an entry for a map will be searched for starting with the newest EMAPINFO lump in the wad
directory (this will be the last such lump in the last wad to be loaded). If an entry is found
for the map in that lump, it will be used and any others are ignored. If an entry is not found,
processing continues through the lumps in the newest wad, and then through lumps in all other
wads in the reverse order they were loaded. If no MapInfo entry is found for a map, the default
values for all variables will apply.
<br><br>

<p>
<a name="priority">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Priority of Level Header MapInfo</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
If a map has both global and level header MapInfo entries, the global entry will be processed
first, and then the level header MapInfo will be processed. This means that level header
MapInfo has a higher priority than global MapInfo, and values specified in the level header
will overwrite values provided by the global lump. This allows maps to keep their specified
individual behaviors even when used with any combination of wads which have global MapInfo
lumps.

<hr>
<b>The Level Header MapInfo System</b>
<hr>
</a>
<br>
SMMU added support for embedding MapInfo into level headers. Although level header lumps
are usually zero length, this is not required by the engine itself, making the level header
a good place to store information associated with a particular map. 

<p>
Since Eternity now supports global MapInfo lumps, the use of level header MapInfo is not
required. It does allow for greater flexibility when combining wads, however, and ensures that
a map will keep critical customized behaviors even in the presence of global MapInfo.

<p>
Note that Eternity currently only supports specification of MapInfo blocks within the level
header. SMMU allowed several other blocks, including one for intertext and one for FraggleScript.
Eternity does not support these blocks and will ignore them if they exist.
<br><br>
<a href="#contents">Return to Table of Contents</a>

<p>
<a name="mhsyn">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Specific Syntax Information</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
In level header MapInfo, variables for the current level must be placed under a section header
that has the name "level info".<br>
Example:
<pre>     [level info]
     levelname = Eternity Start Map
     music = romero
     creator = Derek 'Afterglow' Mac Donald
     skyname = SKY3
     levelscript = STARTSCR</pre>

This would assign all the values beneath the [level info] section header and above any 
subsequent header to the map that possesses this information in its map header lump, overriding
any of the same values which were specified via global MapInfo lumps.

<p>
Notes:
<ul>
<li> If multiple [level info] sections exist in level header MapInfo, all of them will be 
     parsed from top to bottom.
</ul>

<a name="embed">
<hr align="left" width="50%">
<b>Embedding Level-Specific MapInfo</b>
<hr align="left" width="50%">
</a>
<br>
Some editors now include support for embedding MapInfo data into the level header. We recommend
the use of Doom Builder for this functionality. Doom Builder will always respect any existing
MapInfo, whereas many older editors will strip it out when saving the file (this includes
DETH). Doom Builder also has good support for most other features of the Eternity Engine, and
it is open source freeware.

<p>
Please be aware that if your editor strips out data in the level header when saving maps, you
will need to re-embed the level-specific MapInfo after each edit. This and other problems that
external utilities have with data in the level header are one reason why Eternity now supports
global MapInfo. Consider using it instead, or using it only during level development and then
converting it to level header MapInfo if you wish.

<p>
We do not recommend use of the old add_fs utility and will not provide support for its use, 
since it is a DOS command-line utility and only supports wads which contain one map.

<b>Defaults</b>

</a>
<br>
Here you can find specification of the default values that will be used for maps.
Some of the defaults can be edited by DeHackEd as well.

<ul>
<li><b>altskyname</b><br>
    When this variable is not defined, no animation takes place during lightning strikes,
    so there is effectively no default value.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>boss-specials</b><br>
    This variable has special defaults for the following maps:
    <ul>

    <br>

<li><b>colormap</b><br>
    The default value of this variable for all maps is the normal global COLORMAP lump.
    Note that COLORMAP is a special case colormap which is not required to exist between
    C_START and C_END lumps. All other colormaps must follow that rule.

<li><b>creator</b><br>
    The default value of this variable for all maps is "unknown".
    <br><br>

    The default value of this variable for all maps is "false".
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>edf-intername</b><br>
    In Heretic, this variable defaults to "true" for all maps and cannot be disabled.
    Appropriate default values are defined in Eternity's misc.edf file. In all other 
    gamemodes, this value defaults to "false" for all maps. When this value is "true" 
    and a proper string object is defined in EDF, the "levelpic" variable will be 
    completely ignored.

    The default value of this variable for all maps except DOOM II MAP30 is "false".<br>
    The default value for DOOM II MAP30 is "true".
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>extradata</b><br>
    There is no default value for this variable on any map. If no lump name is specified,
    the level does not have ExtraData. Use of ExtraData control things or specials in a map
    which does not have ExtraData may result in "Unknown" things and/or error messages displayed
    to the player.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>finale-secret</b><br>
    The default value for all maps except DOOM II maps MAP15 and MAP31 is "false".<br>

    <br>    

<li><b>killfinale</b><br>
    This variable has the default value of "false" for all maps.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>killstats</b><br>
    This variable has the default value of "false" for all maps except for maps in the
    "hidden" episode of Heretic (Episode 4 in registered Heretic, Episode 6 in Heretic:
    Shadow of the Serpent Riders) and in any higher episode. Those maps default to "true".
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>levelname</b><br>
    This variable has a special default for the following maps. Default values are available
    in the <a href="dehref.html">Eternity Engine DeHackEd / BEX Reference</a> and will not be
    duplicated here because of space constraints.
    <ul>
    <li> DOOM maps E1M1-E1M9, E2M1-E2M9, E3M1-E3M9, E4M1-E4M9
    <li> DOOM II maps MAP01 - MAP32
    <li> Heretic maps E1M1-E1M9, E2M1-E2M9, E3M1-E3M9, E4M1-E4M9, E5M1-E5M9
    <li> Other maps in DOOM or DOOM II: "new level"
    <li> Maps in Heretic with episode 4 or higher: "hidden level"
    <li> Maps in Heretic: SoSR with episode 6 or higher: "hidden level"
    </ul>
    Note that when user wads are added, maps from new wads which do not have a DeHackEd or
    MapInfo level name will use "new level".    
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>levelpic</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:
    <ul>
    <li> DOOM maps ExM1 - ExM9: WILVxy where x is the episode number minus 1 and y is the level
         number minus 1.
    <li> DOOM II maps MAP01 - MAP32: CWILVxy where xy is the 2-digit level number minus 1.
    </ul>
    This value cannot be used for Heretic maps. If the edf-intername variable is set to
    true, no levelpic will be drawn by the intermission. Instead, text strings defined by
    EDF with the proper names will be written to the screen using the large font (FONTB).
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>levelscript</b><br>
    This variable has no default value. If a Levelscript lump is not defined for a map, that
    map has no Levelscript. Attempted use of the Levelscript under that circumstance may result
    in error messages displayed to the player.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>lightning</b><br>
    This variable has the default value of "false" for all maps.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>music</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:

    <li> Heretic maps E2M1-E2M9: E2M1, E2M2, E2M3, E2M4, E1M4, E2M6, E2M7, E2M8, E2M9
    <li> Heretic maps E3M1-E3M9: E1M1, E3M2, E3M3, E1M6, E1M3, E1M2, E1M5, E1M9, E2M6
    <li> Heretic maps E4M1-E4M9: E1M6, E1M2, E1M3, E1M4, E1M5, E1M1, E1M7, E1M8, E1M9
    <li> Heretic maps E5M1-E5M9: E2M1, E2M2, E2M3, E2M4, E1M4, E2M6, E2M7, E2M8, E2M9
    <li> Heretic maps E6M1-E6M9: E3M2, E3M3, E1M6, TITL, INTR, CPTD, E1M1, E1M1, E1M1
    <li> Other maps: No music will be defined. An error message may be shown to the player.
    </ul>
    Remember that in DOOM gamemodes, a "D_" prefix is added to the music name automatically.
    In Heretic gamemodes, a "MUS_" prefix is added. You should NOT add the prefix yourself.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>nextlevel</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:
    <ul>
    <li> DOOM maps ExMy: The next normal level in the episode.
    <li> DOOM II maps MAPxx: The next map.
    <li> DOOM II maps ExMy: The next numeric ExMy map.
    <li> Heretic maps ExMy: The next normal level in the episode.
    <li> Other maps: Maps outside the normal episode range will be wrapped into range if
         no MapInfo value is provided. This means that an E5M1 map in Ultimate DOOM would
         exit to E4M2 if no MapInfo value is provided. In DOOM II, the next level MUST be
         defined or an error will occur. Eternity allows playing of ExMy maps under DOOM II,
         but the levels always exit to the next level in numeric order, including secret maps
         and crossing episode boundaries.
         <br><br>
    </ul>
    
<li><b>nextsecret</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:
    <ul>
    <li> All DOOM maps: ExM9 where x is the current episode number.
    <li> DOOM II map 15: MAP31
    <li> DOOM II map 31: MAP32
    <li> All other DOOM II maps: repeat the same level.
    <li> All Heretic maps: ExM9 where x is the current episode number.
    </ul>
    Note: if nextsecret is defined for a map that does not normally have a secret exit,
    the secret map must also define its nextlevel explicitly. Otherwise, the player may 
    become stuck in the secret level.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>partime</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:
    <ul>
    <li> DOOM maps E1M1-E1M9: 30, 75, 120, 90, 165, 180, 180, 30, 165
    <li> DOOM maps E2M1-E2M9: 90, 90, 90, 120, 90, 360, 240, 30, 170
    <li> DOOM maps E3M1-E3M9: 90, 45, 90, 150, 90, 90, 165, 30, 135
    <li> DOOM II maps MAP01-MAP34:<br>
         30, 90, 120, 120, 90, 150, 120, 120, 270, 90<br>
         210, 150, 150, 150, 210, 150, 420, 150, 210, 150<br>
         240, 150, 180, 150, 150, 300, 330, 420, 300, 180<br>
         120, 30, 30, 30
    </ul>
    Note that par times are not supported for Ultimate DOOM episode 4 or Heretic. Even if
    par values are set for those maps, they will not be displayed by the intermission.
    Also, if DeHackEd/BEX par times are not loaded and a new map does not provide a MapInfo
    par time, the default par time for that map will not be displayed, since it does not
    apply to user-made levels.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>skydelta</b><br>
    This variable has the default value "0" (zero) for all maps.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>sky2delta</b><br>
    This variable has the default value "0" (zero) for all maps.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>skyname</b><br>
    This variable has the following special default values:
    <ul>
    <li> DOOM Episode 1: SKY1
    <li> DOOM Episode 2: SKY2
    <li> DOOM Episode 3: SKY3
    <li> DOOM Episode 4: SKY4
    <li> All other DOOM maps: SKY4
    <li> DOOM II MAP01-MAP11: SKY1
    <li> DOOM II MAP12-MAP20: SKY2
    <li> All other DOOM II maps: SKY3
    <li> Heretic Episode 1: SKY1
    <li> Heretic Episode 2: SKY2
    <li> Heretic Episode 3: SKY3
    <li> Heretic Episode 4: SKY1
    <li> Heretic Episode 5: SKY3
    <li> All other Heretic maps: SKY1
    </ul>
    In the original engine, levels with undefined sky textures would display the AASTINKY or
    AASHITTY textures in the sky via a bug in the texture lookup code. This is not supported 
    by Eternity, which always defines a suitable default sky texture for all maps.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>sky2name</b><br>
    When this variable is not specified by MapInfo, the value of the normal, primary sky
    texture is copied to it.
    <br><br>
    
<li><b>unevenlight</b><br>
    This variable defaults to the value "true" for all DOOM and Heretic maps.

</ul>
